I am 33 years old, married with a child.

I Self Taught studied computer science, and more specifically the 3d graphics. I have later been GNU/Linux System Administrator, it is in this job that I discovered the world of [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html). Following a [VAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validation_des_Acquis_de_l'Experience) of "System and network administrator" in a [CCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_commerce), I moved to [Nantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes).

After a stint as an integrator of [document management system solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_management_system) (developing [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29)), I do a Software Developer training ([level III Title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevet_de_Technicien_Sup%C3%A9rieur)). Then I chained with an accelerated three-month training on developing [SAP/Abap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP) which allowed me to have a permanent contract with [Accenture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture).

I quickly left the close world of SAP for another job as a [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29) [back end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) developer on another project still at Accenture.
