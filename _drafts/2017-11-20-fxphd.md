We'll be using a mixture of live action along with graphical elements created in Photoshop and Fusion. All these will be treated to create a very animated, stylised, motion graphics look..<br>**Class 6** Continuation.<br>**Class 7** Lexus Commercial In yet another three week project we create the illusion of a camera pull back through the inside a car while driving down the road. What we have to work with is quiet different; a stationary car shot on a green-screen stage. To pull off this complicated shot we'll be looking at creating a 3D pan and tile environment, adding contact lighting, realistic reflections and a host of tricks to create the illusion for a moving car..<br>**Class 8** Continuation.<br>**Class 9** Continuation.<br>**Class 10** Aftermath This shot, originally created by Theodor Groeneboom, shows off Fusions 3D and particle tools to the max. This final class goes step by step through the process of creating a building explosion from a single photograph. We'll be covering a whole mixture of techniques and tools including camera projection, particles, colour correction, paint, roto, to name a few. |

| [136](https://www.fxphd.com/details/136/) | [RFL201](https://www.fxphd.com/details/136/) | Particles and Dynamics using RealFlow | **Class 1** Goo Spew: All about RealFlow emitters. No, they don't work like standard particle emitters! This lesson covers conceptual theory to help you understand emitters and so be able to decipher common problems in your simulation scenes. We'll go thru a series of emitters and the meaning of their settings, what they are good for, pitfalls and workarounds. The lesson will also take you thru a variety of RealFlow's interface features, to make sure you know your way around the software..<br>**Class 2** Daemons are your angels in fluid simulations, you use them to push, pull and sculpt fluids  as well as rigid bodies -- to fit with the director's vision. In this lesson we'll go thru a simple project of filling up a container with water, settling it, and then making the fluid "dance" and pour out of the bottle into a wine glass. This covers a series of very common needs in production, especially commercial work..<br>**Class 3** Real projects usually involve fluids interacting with animated geometry, but getting this to work well is not as easy as it seems. We'll look at a seemingly simple scene example of an animated bottle carried, that illustrates some common issues with fast-moving geometry and various ways to get past the major issues. The methods include re-exporting scene geometry, altering substeps and fps settings to allow for fast motion, and removing translation channels in the animated geometry. We'll also have a brief look at another example, that of a car wheel splashing thru a puddle, to see another application of altering the fps and substeps of a simulation scene..<br>**Class 4** In this class we will focus on pure rigid body dynamics. Rigid bodies are handled very efficiently in RealFlow, so it's worth understanding how to use it for when the right opportunity comes up in a project. We rig a basic car model to make it drive down a road, over a ramp jump and through a stack of barrels. The class covers the basics of constraints, the main rigid body dynamics settings, and workarounds to a few issues with the current version..<br>**Class 5** Coupled fluid and rigid bodies: One of the coolest things that RealFlow does is handle "fully coupled" rigid body and fluid dynamics, so you can push objects around with fluid, and have the objects push back. This makes for truly rich, organic and natural results that can be very difficult to achieve with keyframed animation..<br>**Class 6** This lesson dives into controlling your simulations using expressions  something many artists avoid because it tends to get mathematical, to the detriment of their work. We'll build a fairly complex fountain simulation, with 12 mathematically choreographed water spouts. The spouts will be rigged to make their control simple and precise, so you don't have to spend your valuable time making tweaks to 36 separate curves. You will also be introduced to 4 different kinds of useful expressions that will serve you well into your simulation future..<br>**Class 7** OK let's get some sims ready for rendering. We're good at making particles do cool things, now let's coat those clouds of dots with polys. This lesson will cover the ins and outs of meshing, so you can go from lumpy porridge to cheese to whisky. We'll go thru the various settings, and you'll find out what's most useful and what's not so much, plus get tips on workflow so you'll spend less of your time getting to the perfect mesh settings..<br>**Class 8** Elastics: RealFlow simulates other kinds of fluids too, which are less common needs but when you need them, they're good to have. Here we'll do a set of simple simulations with elastics and their related cousin, soft bodies, to check out this squishy behavior and see it's limitations and potential uses..<br>**Class 9** RealWave: Another useful simulation tool that comes with RealFlow is the fluid surface simulator called RealWave. This gets used often in production so it's worth knowing about. This class goes thru a small project involving rigid body dynamics and the surface of a lake, to illustrate a variety of RealWave features. Altho the project is small, this class is rather long as it covers many aspects of the project workflow, such as steps in determining the interaction settings, establishing what should be left in and out of interaction with the realwave, and also issues with realwaves and ideas on how to get around them..<br>**Class 10** Basic Python Scripting for RealFlow:. |

| [139](https://www.fxphd.com/details/139/) | [AVD101](https://www.fxphd.com/details/139/) | Avid for Indie Film and Commercials | **Class 1** In this first class, we go through an overview of Avid and Final Cut, with a focus on resources for Avid. We also begin our project by pulling in footage and starting the edit, which we will continue in the next class, where we go into much more detail around editing and these two systems..<br>**Class 2** Avid Media Composer 3 for Final Cut Pro editors, Part 2 In this second class, we explore the Avid P2 Drive Trick. Then we take a look at a scene from a film shoot using a JVC GY-HD Series Camera, as shot in 720p/24. This scene is first shown in Final Cut Pro, then we move into Avid and start digging into the timeline and editing the footage, with a focus on the scene and assembly. All the footage and the script are provided, along with a P2.zip file..<br>**Class 3** Importing footage into Avid Media Composer. We start by looking at RED footage, then move into Sony XDCAM EX formats, then talk about DPX files and finally we import footage from a Canon HV30 camcorder. Several software packages, including Shake, are mentioned, along with a number of links and resources to help with finding example footage and importing it..<br>**Class 4** we take a look at the alternate, offline footage distributed in Class 03, then finish our "Bar Scene" rough cut. We re-edit the scene using Multi-Camera Editing, then show how to export the scene for for offline review, then talk about a few submissions. And, finally, there's an overview of what is coming in Class 05..<br>**Class 5** Editing That Media Show, Part 1 In this class, we will review the high-quality greenscreen footage provided, along with backgrounds, graphics, a script and audio files. We explore the script for the show, then import the footage, sets, graphics and audio files. After that, we begin Part I of our multi-part edit of the complex footage, which requires editing, keying, effects, audio clean-up, lower thirds and more..<br>**Class 6** Editing That Media Show (Part II) - In this class, we continue the edit of our show, we discuss Avid and Red Giant's Primatte keying solutions, then talk about combining footage and graphics seamlessly and some tricks I use for doing so, we explore resize and blend effects a little more and continue learning about the Avid and its features. A single, high-quality XDCAM EX file from the show is included for advanced keying. A Pro Res version is also included if you cannot use XDCAM..<br>**Class 7** Creating Titles In this class, we discuss the Avid Title Tool, Avid's Marquee tool, Apple's Motion and how they all work. We create custom titles, lower thirds and images using all three of these tools, moving between Avid, Motion, the Avid Title Tool and Marquee.<br>**Class 8** Color Correction Starting with "bit" depth, Gamma and Chroma, then moving into monitor calibration, then discussing background colors. We talk about color correcting in Final Cut Pro, then compare it to Avid Media Composer. We briefly discuss Red Giant's Colorista and Magic Bullet Looks. Sample 1920x1200 desktop background images are provided..<br>**Class 9** In this class, we talk about Audio. The first part goes into how things work in Final Cut Pro, as a point of comparison, then we get into Avid Media Composer, focusing on levels, gain and "audio plugins" (which are really more like filters). SoundSoap is covered briefly, with a focus on removing background hum from an air conditioner. We use footage from one of the earlier classes..<br>**Class 10** In this class, we cover Avid Media Composer timecode, Final Cut Pro timecode (with some tricks in both), Selecting left and right, various other "need to know keys" and Mapping your keyboard in both Final Cut and Avid. The class download includes a keyboard mapping for Final Cut. Lastly, we discuss drive speeds for editing video and measuring those drives for throughput. |
| [140](https://www.fxphd.com/details/140/) | [CLR201](https://www.fxphd.com/details/140/) | Grading with Apple Color | **Class 1** Off and running The approach for this course is to combine color theory and how it has an affect on how we manipulate color. Each class will discuss how we take an approach to color correction in a creative, artistic way to not only create a beautiful image, but address our audience and their emotional perception of these images. Class one hops right into this with the discussion and re-creation of the DUOTONE..<br>**Class 2** Associating color with emotion .<br>**Class 3** Color and symbolism Taking the previous class another step. We'll look at Schinder's list and the effective use of isolated color to create an emotion. In this film, the girl in the red coat became a color representation of the hundreds of thousands of those killed in WW2. We will focus on keying, and using this concept of focusing in on one color to provoke our audience to associate that image with an overall theme..<br>**Class 4** Color through the ages As we look back in time, we can see that each era has a specific look, represented in color to signify that period in time. If we are to prompt our audience to believing they are watching something shot in a certain era in time, we can push this thought process along via color correction. We will take the same piece of film, and manipulate it in color to emulate different points in time..<br>**Class 5** Expressionist theories of color and our use of these ideas today The famous artist Jean-Michel Basquiat used color to force our eyes to a certain area on his canvas. He used saturation to create a sense of depth and emotion. We will take this principle and focus on how we can manipulate an image to force our viewer to a specific area of our frame  by use of depth perception, saturation, and effects tools..<br>**Class 6** The Autochrome.. color from the beginning In 1906, Auguste and Louis Lumiere of France created the autochrome, film's earliest stages of color imagery. Using an additive method of separating an image into separate elements of red, green and blue by the use of potato starch filtering, this beautiful and unique image is worthy of replicating - even today. We will look at a current commercial which shares this imagery, and create our own using film shot today. To appreciate the contemporary use of high end color effects, it is great to step back and take note of these early processes which not only set the path for where we are at this time in color correction, but are relevant even by today's standards, and worthy of replication..<br>**Class 7** MTV awaits This class will have us pushing the envelope as we look into creating funky, fun, high end looks for a music video. Ramp it up!.<br>**Class 8** Continuity is the key This class will look into the issue of continuity  a key element in color correcting anything from commercial to feature films. Continuity ties your piece together, creates a cohesive look as well as commits the viewer to following the story line no matter what twists the environment, lighting, or elements of post production may hand to us..<br>**Class 9** Lighting and its effect on our viewer Lighting. It sets the tone, determines our feelings and prompts a reaction. The way we light a scene convinces our audience of what they are watching and how we want them to feel. We will discuss many aspects about lighting. From how to re-light a scene with issues to simply creating dramatic lighting for enhancement..<br>**Class 10** Copy the masters A fun way to end the course, this class will have us taking the same piece of film (or two or three) and replicating the looks of famous directors and cinematographers. You'll have Danny Boyle chasing you down to color his next award winner!. |

| [142](https://www.fxphd.com/details/142/) | [EDT201](https://www.fxphd.com/details/142/) | The Craft of Editing | **Class 1** The basics of Editing We discuss what is entailed in being a commercial post-production editor. A breakdown of the various aspects of the job are detailed, and we talk about some of the problems an editor encounters being in the chair. The second part presents basic film editing theories, and provides filmic examples of the main styles of editing: continuity and emphatic..<br>**Class 2** We discuss how to go about creating your first cut. Tips are given on how to synthesize footage into manageable selects, and how to structure your cut depending on the type of project. Liz discusses a past editorial project, and traces its evolution from receiving the footage to the approval of its rough cut stage..<br>**Class 3** We look at deconstructing continuity and emphatic editing in practice. Examples are shown from various commercials, and the motivation behind the editorial process is described. Theories described in the first lesson are demonstrated: cutting on action, jump cuts, temporal discontinuity, the 180 rule, and various others. Project 1, an exercise is cutting dialogue, is handed out..<br>**Class 4** Cutting dialogue scenes An example scene is created from dailies, with technique emphasis on continuity and pacing. Tips are given for keeping complicated sequences in sync, as well as how to change out a take in the middle of a scene while retaining the flow of the narrative. A dialogue edit that focuses on compositing is dissected at the end of the lesson..<br>**Class 5** The role of audio  in the editorial cut. Sound design is created for a spot, detailing music editing, sound effects placement, and dialogue finessing. Mix levels are discussed, as well as utilizing time compression. Dialogue replacement is examined in a scene from an independent feature..<br>**Class 6** So now you're an editor .<br>**Class 7** The professor details her cut on assignment 1, explaining her thought process and workflow. Tips and tricks for adding finesse to your edit are also discussed, including flash frames, blurs and an iris effect..<br>**Class 8** Condensing a story We investigate condensing a story line and taking the air out of an edit. A :30 lift is cutdown from a :60 commercial, while paying attention to pacing and sync. In addition, emphatic editing techniques are discussed, such as jump cuts, color correction, speed changes, effect work, and repeat action..<br>**Class 9** The process of finishing a project is dissected. Interviews with a colorist, sound designer/mixer, and smoke artist are conducted. The particular challenges of the ELCA spots are discussed, as well as general information about the workflow in each room..<br>**Class 10** Wrap-Up Critiques are given on Assignment 2, focusing on pacing, music choices, voiceover timing, and shot selection. Tips for getting into the post-production industry are also given. |

| [145](https://www.fxphd.com/details/145/) | [HOU101](https://www.fxphd.com/details/145/) | Introduction to Houdini | **Class 1** Intro to the Interface, Part 1 Get an intro to Houdini's node based, procedural workflow, learn about all of the different types of editors (from modeling to compositing), get your work flow and personal settings going, and find out where to get help, plug ins and more..<br>**Class 2** Intro to the Interface, Part 2 Now that I've shown you where most everything is, let's get used to the interface via a very simple example and put into practice what we learned in the first lesson, so we'll be rockin' as we go through the rest of the term..<br>**Class 3** Continuation.. We use planning and 'trickery' to adjust our source geometry to avoid the problem of our particles not colliding correctly. We also talk about adjusting color preferences for the interface, coloring nodes, adding notes to nodes, bypassing nodes, accessing primitive numbers and using them in the group parameter of SOP nodes, as well as displaying and adjusting point normals to create initial thrust and velocity for our particle system. We then get into the stamp feature of the copy SOP, using a random variable to create varied sizes for the spheres in our particle system..<br>**Class 4** In this lesson, we learn how to load in the dragon object, and load in a back plate. We make point groups to isolate different parts of his body. We then use the soft transform node to adjust the model, and also to create some rudimentary animation on the dragon for our project. Since in production, we'd normally get the file and animation from modeling and animation, we're not doing rigging in this class, and instead continuing to focus on introductory concepts and our focus on fx. We also cover some more concepts of working with nodes and the Houdini interface. Now we will be ready for next week's lesson, where we can take this animated dragon and use the intersection of his wings with the ground and their velocity to drive our particle system that will be used for the dust hits..<br>**Class 5** We continue our dragon dust hits project by learning how to write out the dragon file to disk using a geometry ROP. We'll also continue learning interface tricks, learning to create a netbox to organize our nodes, and discuss adding a Null SOP at the end of node chains to work cleanly. We'll also discuss the object merge node, and how to set up the attribute transfer so that when the wing intersects the ground plane, a point group is created from which we will eventually birth particles. Finally, we'll discuss the geometry spreadsheet as a mode to view point attributes and detailed information in a table format..<br>**Class 6** Continuation, using the point group we created that happens every time the dragon wing intersects the ground plane. We use this point group to birth particles and explore a variety of parameters in the Source POP, including per frame birthing, setting initial velocities using the normal variables, and other information. We then learn about additional POPs to shape and control the particles..<br>**Class 7** In this Lesson we will continue working with pops and finish setup up the motion of the particles. We will also prepare for the lighting and rendering stage..<br>**Class 8** In this lesson we will get a new camera with a better track for our shot, and set up the lighting for the shot. We talk about 3 point lighting, rendering with mantra rops, using mplayer, bundles, shading, shadow mattes, and writing out sequences..<br>**Class 9** In this class we set up a Houdini environment variable, render motion blur and learn about deleting extra attributes. Then we take the passes of the dragon and dragon shadow that we rendered and brought them into cops where we composited them. We also start our shading for the particles, and add an extra attribute to set opacity so that the shader can recognize it. Finally we set up out hold outs for the particles layer..<br>**Class 10** In our final class we will put an fxcomp of all of our elements and see our result. After seeing the comp we will fix some obvious issues that become apparent. Then we will work in VOPs to further develop our dust shader and learn about the rest positon sop. We will also talk about what else could be done to complete the shot and how we would have done the rendering in production if we had those resources. |
| [146](https://www.fxphd.com/details/146/) | [MSV101](https://www.fxphd.com/details/146/) | Introduction to Massive | **Class 1** Getting started The first class in this Introduction to Massive course will give an overview of the Massive software. We will cover the theory of fuzzy logic and how that differs from conventional ideas of boolean or binary logic. I'll give a brief outline of the whole pipeline of creating a Massive agent, then go through the Massive user interface showing each section - the scene, body, brain and motion pages and how they work together. I'll finish by showing one of the ready-to-run Massive agents as an example of a production agent..<br>**Class 2** Body Shop In this class we will look at the Body page in Massive where you define the physical characteristics of a Massive agent. We'll cover agent parameters and look at the various aspects that make up the body of a Massive agent. We'll take a detailed look at the body segments which comprise the skeleton and build a skeleton and collision-shape body for our car agent..<br>**Class 3** Brains! Part 1  This lesson will be the first of a two-part set looking at brains in Massive. It will give detailed coverage of each of the brain nodes, how each one functions "under the hood" and the different ways they can be connected together. We'll discuss fuzzy logic in the context of a Massive brain and show how the brain nodes implement fuzzy logic to control the agent's behavior..<br>**Class 4** Brains! Part 2  We will use what we learned last week to start building the brain of our car agent. We'll set up fuzzy logic networks to handle controls for turning the wheels based on the forward velocity of the car, steering the car by the amount the front wheels are turning left and right, acceleration and braking controls as well as simulating effects such as weight transfer - the way the car's body leans during turns and pitches forward and back when accelerating..<br>**Class 5** Senses In this class we'll cover how a Massive agent uses it's senses such as vision, sound and a new feature of Massive 3.5 called agent fields to allow it to be aware of and react to other agents. We'll continue building the car brain by using the agent's senses to control the systems we set up last lesson such as speed and steering..<br>**Class 6** Environment, Part 1 This lesson will look at how a Massive agent senses and interacts with it's environment and adapts its behavior to match the terrain. We'll also look at how a Massive agent navigates in its environment using flow fields, terrain maps and lanes..<br>**Class 7** Environment, Part 2 We will use what we learned in the previous class to create a simple city environment for the car agents to inhabit. We will set up the lanes for our city environment and look at how to set up all the possible choices of which way to go at different kinds of intersections. We will set up the brain of the car agent to be able to decide which of the lanes to follow depending on which direction it wants to go and the available directions at each intersection..<br>**Class 8** Environment, Part 3 and Variation This lesson we will complete our city environment by creating a traffic light agent to control the flow of traffic at the intersections. We'll also add some rules to allow the cars to give way to cars already on the intersection and avoid collisions. Then we'll look at how you can use agent variables to modify an agent in order to create different kinds of vehicles that share a common brain..<br>**Class 9** Pedestrians In this class we'll finish our simulation by adding pedestrians to our city scene and show how they can interact with each other and the cars..<br>**Class 10** Detailing The final class in this course will cover attaching geometry to an agent and assigning materials to allow us to create a production quality render using Massive's built in hardware based Velocity renderer. We'll also revisit variation and variables in the context of geometry and materials. We'll look at how to create a complete render including shadows as well as separate beauty and shadow passes for compositing. |

| [204](https://www.fxphd.com/details/204/) | [NUK211](https://www.fxphd.com/details/204/) | 3D Relighting Techniques in Nuke | **Class 1** Introduction Part 1 - First we will cover learning material recommendations. We will then illustrate the relighting concept with a basic example in Nuke that uses the built-in shader outputs of the scanline renderer and the somewhat neglected ReLight node. This will be a precursor to using the same kind of shader outputs rendered from PRMan in order to drive relighting in Nuke..<br>**Class 2** Introduction Part 2 - We will begin to look at how to get the render data we need from PRMan to relight in Nuke by writing simple shaders and an accompanying RIB scene description file. Using more complex object and camera placement, we will update our shaders to reflect the need to more robustly define our point and normal data. We will also show how to render our data as arbitrary output variables (AOV's) from a single shader, and how to render to a multichannel OpenEXR file..<br>**Class 3** Using RenderMan Studio(RMS) and Nuke - Using a more complex scene and a moving camera.  We will migrate the hand written shaders over to Slim equivalents and add shader code to render motion vectors to feed the VectorBlur node in Nuke. We will see how to render our custom AOV's from RMS/Maya, and how to enable subpixel output at render time to improve the final result in Nuke..<br>**Class 4** Beyond the ReLight node/Direct Relighting 1 - We'll now start to look at the maths of relighting under the hood so that we can create our own tools in Nuke that utilize the AOV data. We'll build a vector rotation gizmo that will allow Euler rotations and a defined rotation order. We look at how we can use a dot product and Euler rotations with normals to create simple diffuse relighting. We'll use this knowledge to build the guts of a direct relight gizmo that works in Nuke's 3D space..<br>**Class 5** Direct Relighting Part 2 - We build a point relighting tool in Nuke that works in 3D space, and touch briefly on what goes into making a spotlight. We will also cover a basic example of how we can place a shadow camera in the same position as a spotlight in Nuke and send the placement info back to Maya to render a shadow pass through RMS..<br>**Class 6** Direct Relighting Part 3 - We will build a point relighting tool in Nuke that works in 3D space and use that as the starting point for making a spot relighting tool. We will also cover a basic example of how we can export spotlight placement from Nuke back to Maya to render a shadow pass through RMS..<br>**Class 7** Image-Based Relighting Part 1 - How to render ambient occlusion, bent normals and reflection occlusion passes to be used in Nuke for diffuse and specular image-based relighting.  We'll also see how bent normals can be used in place of "true normals" for direct relighting applications..<br>**Class 8** Image-Based Relighting Part 2 - Continuing from the last class, we create both diffuse and specular image-based relighting methods, using HDRI environment maps.  We'll combine the result with the ambient and reflection occlusion passes we previously rendered, and create a simple fresnel effect in Nuke to further attenuate our environment reflections.  We'll composite all our rendered and derived AOV's into a final image..<br>**Class 9** Advanced Environment Map Applications in Nuke Part 1 - In this class we first project a full environment map onto 3D geometry in Nuke. We will then render a sequence for a new spatially-aware environment map that is animated based on the position of an object moving through that 3D scene. We can then use this animated environment map with the Nuke Environment Light as well as our specular image-based relighting tools to light the object in a more convincing way..<br>**Class 10** Advanced Environment Map Applications in Nuke Part 2 - Following on from the last class, we will replace the sphere reference object with an animated character moving through the Nuke 3D scene to produce a final relit shot. |

| [233](https://www.fxphd.com/details/233/) | [PRM201](https://www.fxphd.com/details/233/) | Intermediate Premiere Pro CS5 | **Class 1** Intro to PPro - While Premiere Pro has an interface that does seem.<br>**Class 2** Getting your hands dirty: Native Edit: DSLR - This class will both.<br>**Class 3** Layers and Vectors: Smart Graphics in Premiere Pro - Adobe Premiere Pro has been the most capable NLE for handling graphics from Illustrator and Photoshop for some time. Handling Photoshop layers in groups or individually and using the vector structure in Illustrator files to scale and manipulate vector logos and graphics cleanly through continuous re-rasterization are two of the areas we’ll focus on. Before the end of class, we’ll touch on what may be one of the best “original equipment” title tools in any NLE..<br>**Class 4** Metadata, Transcripts, and Media Analysis - Adobe Premiere Pro is on the second generation of its voice-recognition technology, and the creation of usable transcripts from audible human speech seems to be a real possibility. We’ll look at that, PPro’s media analysis for face recognition, and Adobe’s nearly product line-wide muscle for handling metadata..<br>**Class 5** Getting your hands dirty: Edit: RED R3D - Apparently there’s this camera…maybe you’ve heard of it? What you may not have heard is how the workflow in Adobe Premiere Pro keeps the footage in RAW by actually handling the R3D files and allows you to actually access the decode/demosaic parameters on footage in your edit project and make changes to the demosaic settings, primary color correction, exposure…even the camera ISO. This workflow is why you chose to shoot RAW in the first place….<br>**Class 6** Color Correction - Altering the visual aesthetic of your shots depend on feedback from the waveform and vectorscope and RGB and YíCrCb parade displays in the interface. Color "correction" in Premiere Pro is one area where many users would love to see some faster evolution taking place, but the tools are there, and are far from basic. You just need to know where to find them. **Class **includes detailed techniques for utilizing the tools inside Premiere Pro CS5 and a short introduction to Magic Bullet's Colorista v2..<br>**Class 7** Premiere Pro CS5 Effects workflow - Video effects in Premiere Pro are GPU accelerated, 32 bit float, and come in RGB and Y’CbCr color structures…but most effects have a subset of these attributes. Sorting them out and using them effectively is key to preserving the visual quality of your project and the weekends of the editor..<br>**Class 8** Hearing is Believing: Audio in Premiere Pro CS5 - When you think about video editing applications and how they each handle audio…which ones do you think do a really competent and nuanced job of it? Premiere Pro may not be the first application that pops into your head…but then we haven’t had this class yet… Track-based AND clip-based audio effects and mixing concepts will be covered so that you can adopt a workflow for yourself, using the tools that you’re most comfortable with..<br>**Class 9** Unraveling the Dynamic Link - Once you move into Adobe’s “CS5 Production Premium”, you may end up reconsidering whether or not “codependence” is a bad thing. Premiere Pro’s working relationship with its collegial applications is tight and frankly, Adobe’s Dynamic Link technology can create some fascinating post production workflow efficiencies..<br>**Class 10** 3D Workflow with CineForm, AJA - CineForm has what may be the best stereoscopic media structure available right now. With an AJA card, or cards, and the ability to send the two eyes of your editing project to a variety of stereoscopic displays and projectors, AND change the “3D” parameters while you continue to edit, this workflow is definitely worth watching. We’ll cover Premiere Pro CS5, CineForm NEO 3D (available on a 15 day free trial), and CineForm First Light (included in the NEO 3D package.). |
| [234](https://www.fxphd.com/details/234/) | [RFL202](https://www.fxphd.com/details/234/) | Real Flow 5 Project Workshop | **Class 1** Oveview. Like all mature CG packages, RealFlow is a maze of details, features and parameters. This class functions as a quick overview to highlight those aspects that are crucially important to most project work, to help you sort thru what's important, and what you can not worry about (for the most part). In the class we'll go over the elements of the UI that you need to know; menu items that are important but often overlooked by even experienced fx artists; the core functionalities so you know what's RealFlow can do; and the basic workflow that you'll use over and over again in your work..<br>**Class 2** Particle Fluids, Part 1 - Art-directed pour into a glass - If you start using RF for production, you will be surprised how often you find yourself doing a pour of fluid into a glass. Weirdly, each time you do it, the project needs will be sufficiently different that you'll find it challenging, making it worth a class. Also, it makes a great intro to dealing with particle emitters, daemons, object interaction and the standard workflow. Here we'll pour fluid from a bottle into a glass according to specific shot needs, and make the fluid behave in a naturalistic, yet art-directed way. The art-direction is always the source of the challenge..<br>**Class 3** Particle Fluids, Part 1 - Forming a word out of rain hitting a windshield - In this class we'll continue to explore particle-based fluids and their interaction with objects, this time creating a rain storm hitting a car, and using the fluid to form a logo on the windshield..<br>**Class 4** Meshing and options for visualizing your sim results - After you've created your simulations, you have to render them. There's now quite a wide variety of ways to do that, but typically this involves generating meshes around your particles first. We'll cover the ways of meshing in RealFlow. Also, we'll discuss alternative methods of meshing and also particle rendering, to give you a broader feeling for how to turn your results into images..<br>**Class 5** Getting to know grid fluids - Flood-forming a logo - RealFlow 5 includes a brand new fluid solver called a grid fluid, and in this class we'll start working with it. It's designed for doing larger-scale simulations, so we'll start by forming a logo with a giant flood..<br>**Class 6** Grid fluids 2 - Beach scene - Part 1 of 2 - In this class, we'll extend our knowledge of the grid fluid solver by creating an oceanside simulation of waves washing up on a beach..<br>**Class 7** Grid fluids 2 - Beach scene - Part 1 of 2.<br>**Class 8** Realwaves intro - making a basic ocean surface.<br>**Class 9** Rigid bodies and basic use of Python, Part 2 - Firehosing a moving target near a swimming pool - Set up a rigid body sim of a swimming pool scene and a moving target. Use the previous targeting script to shoot a fluid jet at a pinata swinging on the end of a chain over a pool. When hit, have it break apart. Have the rigid bodies and the fluid interact with the pool..<br>**Class 10** Extending Python - Building a custom force field to make a lava lamp - Create a scripted force field that makes fluid oscillate up and down in a container, making a lava lamp. |

For 100 years cinematographers did their best to try to eliminate lens flares! These days because of the amount of computer generated imagery we work with, lens flares and light artifacts can add more realism to your shots. They can also be used to add dynamism to text or logos and create more interesting transitions. Knoll Light Factory lets you design, adjust and animate multiple styles and types of flares. We'll be running through adding lens flares to footage, how to composite flares on several layers, the differences between the software hosts (FCP and After Effects), 8bit vs 10bit vs 16 bit rendering, and creating transitions as well as adding light flourishes to FCP text..<br>**Class 9** Warp. Editors are often called on to 'fix' shots and to add in screen elements. Warp lets you composite graphics onto computer and TV screens within your footage using corner-pinning to match the perspective. It also lets you add adding reflections and throw-shadows to graphics and text. These are things that you'd traditionally have to do in After Effects or Motion, but we'll be analysing when to use them, and how these techniques can be performed quickly without leaving FCP..<br>**Class 10** Radium Glow. With a library of glow types and shapes, multiple sliders and controls, and three different filters within one plugin, Radium Glow lets you add sparkling glows and highlights to footage with the ability to manipulate each glow to create natural glints as well as stylised twinkles. There are settings that can speed up the rendering times and we'll show how to make sure that your super-bright glows stay broadcast legal. We'll also be covering how you can set up effective animations with the minimum of keyframes to create interesting flourishes on the timeline - all without leaving Final Cut Pro!. |

From here we look at iDistort which also works with UV data and can be used to add various effects such as heat refraction, etc. We then go on to take an in-depth look at Nuke's fantastic 3D Tracker and how 3D geometry can be integrated into a shot based off the Point Cloud data generated. We end the class looking at the DensePointCloud node which is useful for positioning objects in 3D or as a starting point for model building. Using this data we then create a 3D mesh using the PoissonMesh node which can be used to project onto..<br>**Class 6** Rig Removal, Clean-up, Set Extension and AOV Passes (1 hour 40 mins Approx.) - Project 7 - In our sixth class we start by removing some camera track rails from our project. We do this in two ways, firstly using a UV unwrap approach and then using a projection setup. We then pull various keys on the green screen areas of the plate, along with utilizing the 3D roto system we learnt earlier in the course. Next we bring in some geometry and create a 3D room based off of projections and composited into our main shot. From here we look at building an outside set using various cards and other geometry types inside of Nuke. The final part of the class focuses on Arbitrary Output Variables (or AOV) including Fresnel, zDepth, Motion Vector, Position, Normal, UV, and Mattes..<br>**Class 7** Stereoscopic (1 hour Approx.) - Project 8 - In this class we look at Nuke's ability to work with Stereo projects.

First we setup a 3d projection of our set by converting a latlong into a series of cubic maps. We then focus on keying a more complex shot, focusing primarily on maintaining hair detail and using clean plates..<br>**Class 9** We take a look at some 3d renders. The main goal of this lesson is to give an idea of how one can approach compositing a piece multi channel cgi. Focusing on the process, we break the renders down into their component parts, start to gain a perspective on where we want to take them creatively, and then start to have a play. This lesson is intended to be a spring board to push you forward into the big task of compositing the rest of the shots for this sequence. We also take a look at a way of fixing the buzzing hair issues that are apparent on several of the shots..<br>**Class 10** The big finale! We start an entirely new and exciting shot which is going to look heavyweight on your reels. We take in our renders, rebuild our entire environment with projections. We fix issues, grade plates, use some nifty tricks for layout and take it to a nice a looking conclusion. |

| [286](https://www.fxphd.com/details/286/) | [DOP213](https://www.fxphd.com/details/286/) | DSLR Filmmaking | **Class 1** The basic gear. From the camera to the lenses, we'll examine Sheahan's basic kit and basic camera set up..<br>**Class 2** When less is more. Sheahan rarely shoots with more than one light. It may sound lazy, but it gives motion photography both a distinctive look when he wants it as well as a more natural look. Choosing that one light is important as are the non-light tools used to fill in areas that need a little help. Members will be asked to use that one light, in this lesson's exercise..<br>**Class 3** When that one light is the sun. Sheahan loves shooting in available light and it's the light we're all most familiar with. However, it's an extremely powerful light source; constantly changing and it needs to be controlled to get the look one is after. Building on the one artificial light discussion from the previous session, we'll talk about some non-lighting tools as well as neutral density filters which are used to help tame the sun to get the look we're after..<br>**Class 4** Continuing on our available sunlight topic we'll discuss how using neutral density along with the advanced picture styles in your camera not only allow you more options with your camera aperture settings, they also allow you more options for color grading in post. Sometimes it's best not to commit to a look during your shoot when you don't have to. Also we have an interview with architectural photographer Marian Kraus..<br>**Class 5** We've gotten spoiled with RAW. Sometimes to better understand the present, we have to look to the past. Shooting images in RAW has allowed us so many ways to manipulate our images. But when shooting h.264 on our DSLRs it's like turning back the clock a decade or two to the days of shooting transparency film when exposure and color temperature mistakes were not easily fixable if fixable at all. We'll discuss the parallels between transparency film and shooting h.264 and how choosing your white balance can help get you half way to your desired color grading look..<br>**Class 6** We all need a little support. The great thing about HDSLR cameras is that they're small and lightweight. The horrible thing about HDSLRs is that they're small and lightweight. The ergonomics of shooting video with HDSLRs is less than ideal. We'll talk about tripods and gliders and how and when to use them. Stationary or glide? Just because you can, doesn't mean you should all of the time..<br>**Class 7** HDSLR rigs: So many choices and so much money. Let's navigate through what you need in an HDSLR rig to help you pick what you need to achieve the look you want before you spend more than the cost of your camera and lenses. Matte boxes, follow focus, hand held or on a support system and monitoring? It really depends what and how you're shooting..<br>**Class 8** Sometimes pre-visualization and planning can really help make a shoot go more smoothly. In class 08, we'll take a look at a few apps for the iPad and iPhone that really help me to arrive on set prepared. And then we'll take one of those apps and literally give it a test drive. How do you mount a DSLR camera on a car and manage to monitor it while driving? I'll show you my method of camera mounting and ways to shoot interesting angles from a vehicle. And one of them involves time-lapse photography..<br>**Class 9** We've been talking a lot about shooting flat to allow your colorist the maximum amount of options during a color grading session. We'll head to Color Playground to talk with Kelly Armstrong who will show us how she would work with some of the footage we've been shooting in class and get her viewpoint on color and working with DOPs. Then we'll look at the other side of the camera as we sit down with Musician/Actor/model Jillian Ann and discuss some things she looks for when collaborating with people behind the camera. That's us. Two very interesting discussions..<br>**Class 10** Something for everyone. We've packed this lesson with a variety of subjects, grouped into four sections: Timelapse tips and tricks when shooting timelapse from daylight to night, Shooting at 29.97 for 23.98 to introduce a slight slo-motion effect and how to keep a music video track in sync, workflow practices and software to get your media from camera to your editing system, and finally a discussion on some key professional business topics to help you keep making your art, including the Cost of Doing Business Calculator, stills vs. motion usage and copyright, insurance and why you need it to shoot in a professional environment, helpful industry organizations and best practices for backing up up your precious media files. |

We'll look at working both ways - from the solids to the fluids, and from the fluid to the solids, setting up and controlling FumeFX simulations..<br>**Class 10** Management - Looks at the key points of managing the FX process, start to finish. A way to set up a good base for any FX element in the start, and assembling all the pieces of the puzzle together for rendering. |
| [289](https://www.fxphd.com/details/289/) | [HOU203](https://www.fxphd.com/details/289/) | Water Effects in Houdini 11 | **Class 1** Mainly theory and lecture. It lays down the foundation for understanding the more advanced properties of fluid simulations. We discuss the three types of fluid simulations available in Houdini, Voxel Based, SPH (particle), and FLIP. There is a complete breakdown of all three simulation methods including example scenes..<br>**Class 2** You will build upon your fundamental theories and concepts that you learned already by learning how to set up volume, sph and FLIP fluid simulations. Also, you will explore the most common and useful parameters of each and gain some insight as to why FLIP is so powerful and the reason we'll be using it extensively in our project..<br>**Class 3** Begin customizing the FLIP fluid simulation by first discussing different methods of emission, setting up clipping limits for efficiency and creating effective collision geometry. Discuss getting data in and out of DOPs and common work flows such as caching methods, writing out .sim data and/or .bgeos and where to find information about distributed simulation..<br>**Class 4** Discuss some of the scene optimizations such as the .bgeo file format and only using one single piece of geometry for our fountain. Explore in detail different techniques and strategies for working with different scene scales in a fluid simulation by adjusting important parameters and using specific DOPs while analyzing the advantages and disadvantages for each of the setups. Cover methods to export .sim data and using an initial state. Quickly go over a couple simple VOP SOPs such as animated noisy volume and a velocity visualization tool..<br>**Class 5** Explore a variety of ways to fill up our water fountain bowls by first using the particle fluid object's initial data option to turn geometry into particles as well as converting the geometry into our own set of points and using the particle field type for the initial data..<br>**Class 6** We cover some basic secondary effects for our fountain simulation. We float leaves on the water surface. First we show this on the ripple surface, and then demonstrate the technique using the mesh generated by the particle fluid surface. Instead of using shelf tools, we build our on set of custom DOPs nodes in order to push the leaves around in the water using the velocity field from the FLIP solver..<br>**Class 7** We take a closer look at secondary effects for fluid simulations. First, a review of some reference footage so that we may get a better idea of what types of secondary effects we might need. Next we cover advanced DOPs techniques and build our own solver for calculating turbulence. We look at certain SOPs solutions for creating spray on a wave based on the curvature of the surface. We also check out the performance monitor and look at ways of optimizing the fountain scene to get a faster more efficient simulation..<br>**Class 8** Briefly talk about the new simulation and the meshing parameters used to get our fluid mesh. Cover how to set up an environment light with an HDR that has been modified in COPs. Set up an area light for nicer lighting and shadows. Discuss the Mantra ROP and some of the important parameters to look at when rendering liquids and setting up Micropolygon Physically Based Rendering. Talk about Caustics and Photon Map generation. Then set up takes to separate out individual render passes and bring them into COPs where we composite them together. Look at some quick tricks to fake some shadows and lighting changes in our composite..<br>**Class 9** We address the final touches to our fountain project. We take a closer look at the individual elements of a rendered fluid simulation. We discuss how to export out custom foam attribute as a separate image plane by creating custom renderable parameters inside the basic fluid shader. After that the footage is brought into Nuke for the final composite..<br>**Class 10** A variety of methods for artistically controlling the motion of a fluid in Houdini are. These include creating custom velocity fields to use with the field force dop and gas particle to field dop, using a sop vector field with the gas calculate dop and using POPs attractors along with the ballistic attribute. With all of these different tools for controlling the motion of fluid simulations, pretty much any type of fluid effect can be achieved now. |

| [291](https://www.fxphd.com/details/291/) | [SIL201](https://www.fxphd.com/details/291/) | Intermediate SilhouetteFX | **Class 1** Motion tracking. Tracking is key to fast and accurate rotoscoping work. In this first project we explore different techniques to get the most useful track we can. This is not necessarily as straightforward as object tracking..<br>**Class 2** Approaching a shot. In this project we analyze a shot to see how we can tackle it in the shortest time possible without compromising the result. We focus on the main roto toolset, tackling camera motion and motion blur..<br>**Class 3** Wire Removal - This week we look at wire removal and the Paint node. When prepping this shot for fast and consistent results, we will build on our motion tracking skills..<br>**Class 4** Anamorphic and cropped footage. Tweaking SilhouetteFX's inner preferences make working with anamorphic and scanned footage a whole lot easier. Hair is the focus of this class, how do we blend mattes and masks to create the best result..<br>**Class 5** Hands. Breaking down extremities is never easy. We will build up a hierarchy to keep this complex shot manageable and understandable for another artist to complete..<br>**Class 6** Power matte. This week we look at how to create a detailed matte using the Power Matte node. We look at maintaining motion blur and fine edge detail. Use quick shapes rather than keyers or accurate rotosplines to speed through the shot. Finally, what to do when we need to clean up the results manually..<br>**Class 7** Human roto part 1. Predictably irrational movement is the focus this week. How do we start to tackle large movements, rotation, spinning and obscuration..<br>**Class 8** Human roto part 2. Carrying on the project from last week. More focus placed on limbs and joints..<br>**Class 9** Stereoscopic workflow. As stereoscopic 3D becomes increasingly part of the everyday workflow, how do our techniques have to change? We explore a typical SilhouetteFX workflow to get the pixel accurate results we need..<br>**Class 10** Interoperability. The data we have been creating in SilhouetteFX cannot exist in a vacuum. We can export to a number of different formats, with their own advantages and disadvantages. As importantly, we will also import tracking and shape data from other applications to SilhouetteFX to speed our work up. |
| [292](https://www.fxphd.com/details/292/) | [MYA214](https://www.fxphd.com/details/292/) | Maya Lighting and Rendering in Production | **Class 1** Introduction: Week one's video is all about getting up to speed, so we're covering the shaders, a quick brdf tour, projections and why we're going linear with our colourspace. There's also a lighter's tour of Nuke, as we'll be using it quite heavily and its important you know its main functionality..<br>**Class 2** What we know from the set's lighting, and creating/calibrating the HDRI environment/grey-ball/lights, giving us our look-development scene..<br>**Class 3** The grey ball, basically..<br>**Class 4** Convolutions and ARBs, and what they let us do..<br>**Class 5** Grading our HDRI, even when we make it difficult for ourselves..<br>**Class 6** Referencing and some minor pipeline automation.<br>**Class 7** Reflection rules and shaders: Week seven sees us start to lookdev our shaders, but also gets us up to speed on how real life material reflection values relate to what we can achieve in mental ray, how they are portrayed in optics and what we can do to mimic that (and also what we can't)..<br>**Class 8** We finish off our materials development phase by examining the difference between the possibilities we have for matching metals, and adapt our environment to deal with the noise. Its all about getting ready for the final assault on the machine model..<br>**Class 9** Render time... Our modeller, Oliver Kane, has given us our giant machine, so this week we're going to render it - or at least start. We go through our referencing process to help manage file sizes and start our two lighting setups, all of which leads to the week ten finale....<br>**Class 10** The End. |
| [293](https://www.fxphd.com/details/293/) | [MOG210](https://www.fxphd.com/details/293/) | The Broadcast Ident | **Class 1** Concept Development - We look at the initial boards created for the ident and the concepts and scripts behind them. From this selection of ideas, one is chosen and we discuss a practical approach to shooting the footage. Tim shares his experiences of working with the RED Epic and after a brief overview of working with RED Cine, we choose our selects from the RED footage. This is then narrowed down to one shot. Whilst working with RED Cine we explore some of the looks we could output when we grade our shot..<br>**Class 2** We create the animatic for the ident using Adobe After Effects CS5.5. Although the work is quite simple, it is an essential part of the process and this will create a solid foundation for building upon over the following weeks..<br>**Class 3** Model the joystick in Cinema4D. Covering many of the most commonly used tools when modelling with hyperNURBS including, knife, edge cut, extrude, loop and ring selection. We also look at an alternative method available when using the Correction Deformer..<br>**Class 4** Tracking the tunnel shot in Syntheyes. Using supervised tracking we will track and solve the tunnel shot. Covers general workflow in Syntheyes. Solving difficult shots. Clean up trackers. Creating a coordinate system. Exporting python script for C4D..<br>**Class 5** Style Frame, Render and Comp - Taking the tracking data into Cinema4D we can start to incorporate 3D elements into the live action plate. We will build proxy elements of the live action plate from the tracking data which we will use as shadow catchers and other composite helpers. This will also allow us to develop our 3D - 2D pipeline for the project, discovering which passes need to be rendered. Any problems associated with this and allowing us plenty of time to find solutions. Outputting out a still frame using multipass render layers will give us the opportunity to develop our style frame..<br>**Class 6** 3D Animation, Render and Comp - In this class we will animate the 3D elements. This is the first blocking stage and we will attempt to animate all the elements and prepare them for output. The render passes will be created, output and brought into the composite for review..<br>**Class 7** Creating the graphic elements in Cinema4D. Using the knife tool to create cuts for generating splines from the tunnel geometry. Cloner Object to clone graphics along the splines. SplineWrap to deform geometry along the splines..<br>**Class 8** Animating the graphic elements appearing through the shot. Working with effectors to control scale, visibility and time offset keyframed animation of cloned objects. Using constraints for dynamic parenting. Morphing with Pose Morph and baking the resulting morph to point level animation..<br>**Class 9** Finding and correcting errors in the scene so far. Creating some basic materials for the graphics, using formula effector and multishader. Generating geometry through collision using Bool, Matrix object and Tracer. Preparing file for multipass rendering..<br>**Class 10** Final Grade and Output - We will take our 3D elements and bring them into the composite we have been building. Our 2D graphic elements will be finalized and the grade completed. The comp will be setup for final render, we will then review the result and discuss the overall project process. |
| [294](https://www.fxphd.com/details/294/) | [MOD301](https://www.fxphd.com/details/294/) | Advanced Environment Modeling | **Class 1** Planning and reference - As with any challenging project the planning and preparation stage is of vital importance. The more complex the model, the more planning you are going to be required to do. This 1st lesson covers planning out how we will model and texture the interior of Durham Cathedral to a photo real level for use as a chroma key background. It'll also cover how to get photo reference of a place that you aren't allowed to take photos of (as is the case with Durham cathedral where absolutely no photography is allowed.).<br>**Class 2** Blocking out the main architectural forms - With a model as complex as this one it can be very easy to either lose your way or just try and 'wing it ' as your going along. A much lower stress way is to do a low res block in of the major forms of the cathedral interior as we'll do in this lesson..<br>**Class 3** We cover the creation of some repeatable assets for our model of Durham Cathedral's interior..<br>**Class 4** This week we're going to complete most of the many different types of column deigns and also create the asset for the vaulted ceiling..<br>**Class 5** We finish off the remaining columns and model the rose window. We also create the vaulted ceiling for the transepts which differs from the main nave vaulted ceiling..<br>**Class 6** Sculpting and adding the Gargoyles - Durham doesn't have any gargoyles in its interior, but as these have been requested by the art director we will make and place these gargoyles in a way that is both sympathetic to the architectural design and in a non offensive way. (Which is often of prime importance when you are creating a religious building.).<br>**Class 7** Detailing and Damaging - So far we have a nice cathedral but it looks like it was just built last week, so it's time to cause a bit of wear and tear to it. So in this lesson we'll cover how tm sculpt a convincing stone damage and add the damage of hundreds of years to our cathedral..<br>**Class 8** Texturing Durham Cathedral - Texturing a model this size can be a complex and long job if not approached with an eye to how the asset is to be used. So as we cover the creation of our texture sets, we'll also cover a few tips and tricks..<br>**Class 9** Materials & Lighting - It's time to put our maps into some proper materials and give our cathedral an overall lighting scheme..<br>**Class 10** Setting up our render passes and doing our final renders - As well as covering the final stage for this model to be taken to a final render stage for each shot, we'll also be recapping what we have covered during this course and answering any question that have popped up about the workflows on the forums. |

Best practices for round-tripping between FCP and Resolve 8, including grading the multi-level timeline. Working with AAF from Avid, including re-linking in Resolve and round tripping back to Avid. For those times when things go wrong, we'll show how to confirm a shot that will not re-link with material in Media Pool..<br>**Class 3** Nodes/Primaries. “The Primary controls are the most important Resolve control you will ever use. If you cannot get a great balance to begin with you will find it so much harder to do the cool stuff down the track.” We'll look at basic node operation, the serial node, waveforms, scopes, and the histogram. In addition, we'll cover the primary controls, auto color, RGB mixer, offsets, YUV corrector, curves, soft white clip and more..<br>**Class 4** Secondary Corrections. “I will show you why we use them, not just how to make them.” This includes fixed six vector secondaries, chroma light @ dark, the picker, keying using the HSL option, and the new V8 secondary hue curves..<br>**Class 5** Power Windows. "Everything I have ever graded had a product of some sort, either a Ford car in a commercial, a leading actor in a movie, or a famous singer in a music clip. You have to make them stand out because that is what your clients will be looking at.” We'll look at Circle and Linear Power windows as well as Poly and Power Curve windows. The tracker is fantastic, but what do you need do do on those occasions when it doesn’t track and you have to manually fix the track? We'll look at auto tracking, manual tracking, fixing broken tracks and image stabilization. You'll also see how to do practical tasks such as tracking cars and people as well has how to track a window off the screen..<br>**Class 6** Advanced Node operation. “The real power of Resolve is truly unleashed when you understand all the nodes and what they do. It took me a while to understand the true power of each of the nodes. When you do it unlocks many creative options”. This class will look at the parallel, layer, and keyer nodes. We'll use these nodes to show how to bring that original product shot color back through your desaturated cool wash. Using the key mixer node, you'll see how to quickly grow a complicated node tree and how to combine keys to make grading faster. PTZR repositioning in the timeline and ALL/COL/PTZR  why this is important to correctly mark our timelines when doing dynamic changes..<br>**Class 7** Conforming, grading, then outputting a film shot on RED. “I always use the Playheads at the start of my session, clients love the interaction of this feature”. We'll conform a short sequence shot on RED using anamorphic lenses and learn how to deal with aspect ratios. Then it's on to render and the formats we can render to, batch request and the render queue, real time proxies/render cache nodes, and wipes and green screen. You'll also see how to create your own effects library of looks with power grades, exporting/importing stills for comparing grades, grouping shots to make grading easier, using playheads to view multiple shots at the same time, and using versioning to easily make alternative grades..<br>**Class 8** Stereo 3D Grading. “Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, Avatar all graded in stereo on Resolve. How hard can it be?” Setting up your project, auto matching tools for both the color and geometry differences between eyes, picture alignment, and the various grading and viewing options for Stereo 3D. We'll also use the difference view to judge and change convergence, determining what comes out of the screen plane or sits behind it, and dealing with questions as to how stereo grading makes you feel physically..<br>**Class 9** Grading Film Digital Material. “Give me a piece of 35mm film shot on a sunny day…a quick adjustment and it looks fabulous. That's not often the case these days. How to get the best out of the new digital formats and what to look out for.” We examine the pros and the cons of digital formats, the controls we have in Resolve, and how to use and create LUTs. In addition, we'll specifically examine formats such as Canon 7D/5D, RED and Epic, Arri Alexa RAW vs. Arri ProRes 444, and the Sony F3..<br>**Class 10** Control Surfaces. “The surfaces supported by Resolve are all very different, try before you buy and find the one that suits you, I guarantee you’ll find it more fun than grading with a mouse” A brief introduction on what the control surface options are and what my own thoughts are on each one. This includes taking a look the BMD Resolve surface, the Tangent Wave, and the Avid Artist and seeing what the buttons and controls do on each panel, customization, connection, shortcuts, and the general feeling of the joyballs and rings. |

We take a stereo native shot that was done on a mirror rig, and use Ocula to conform and fix complex stereo flaws in the images geometry, color, and polarization differences..<br>**Class 2** Desolate City. Part 2 - Paint and rig removal. Using 3D tracking, projection, and paint we clean up our stereo plate. We use Nuke to remove unwanted reflections, people who walked though the shot that do not belong, and camera equipment left in frame. These techniques are often used when a set cannot be 100% closed and you need to remove people who are watching the production and standing where they do not belong..<br>**Class 3**: Desolate City. Part 3 - We take our new cleaned plate and track it in PFtrack 2011, do a sky replacement, add a burning car, and start exploring a final look..<br>**Class 4** Desolate City. Part 4 - We final our shot by adding zombies! We take a close look at matching shadows, black points, and colors to integrate the horde of hungry flesh eaters. We'll add an infected zone sign, create a new reflections, add more atmosphere, and finalize our shot..<br>**Class 5** Zombie Attack! Part 1 - In this class we take footage of an actor attacking a zombie. We will do green screen keying, integration, and extending a stand-in prop into a CG metal pipe..<br>**Class 6** Zombie Attack! Part 2 - We add Nuke particle system blood spray. Use the spline warper to add impact, and clean up our shot and make it final..<br>**Class 7** Digital Makeup. Part 1 - Face replacement makeup. We will take footage of our actor and plan out the make up and do a rough composite, getting the shot ready for tracking. We will be mixing different camera interaxial settings and re-converging the elements to fit in 2D and 3D space. We will talk about what parts will need to be replaced and agumented and plan the out the next steps..<br>**Class 8** Digital Makeup. Part 2 - Eye replacements. We will also look at techniques to replace the eyes of our actor with a digital full ocular contact lens. Eyes are the windows to the soul and special attention must be paid attention to get this effect right..<br>**Class 9** Digital Makeup. Part 3 - Bruises and blood. We will track a face using PFtrack, remove tracking markers, and add digital makeup. Bruises, blood and burns will be added by unwrapping the face geometry UV's adding the effects and remapping and generating layers for the final composite..<br>**Class 10** Digital Makeup. Part 4 - Subtractive prosthetics. After adding our digital makeup, we will now remove a chunk of the persons head and reveal the background behind. We will need to create a clean plate, new geometry to attach to our track and render and blend it into the edges. We also reuse parts of ouor comp to craete a depth matte to convert our 2D element into 3D for the final stereoscopic composite. |

| [306](https://www.fxphd.com/details/306/) | [ANI101](https://www.fxphd.com/details/306/) | Introduction to Character Animation | **Class 1** What Makes a Good Rig - As the course is designed to be platform agnostic, one may have to find a rig for their specific application. This first lesson will take a look at what to look for in a good rig, common control designs, and how to work with a rig in regards to selections, manipulation, and keyframing..<br>**Class 2** Getting familiar with Posing: Just because one knows how to keyframe, doesn't mean that they can make a nice character animation. Besides the 12 basic animation principles, an animator needs strong posing skills. Before we run into animating we'll take some smaller steps into silhouette and posing..<br>**Class 3** Planning - Planning is more than simply an idea. You have to think about your character, know how they would act and why. Sketches, Acting, and Video recording simplify the rest of the workflow by serving as a solid foundation for your animation..<br>**Class 4** Blocking - We'll finally begin to animate our scene. The first lesson will be to block out the most vital Key Poses. While only a few poses, these are the ones where silhouette and clarity are most essential..<br>**Class 5** Principles - Now that we have some key poses it is a good time to take into consideration principles of animation and plan out how we are going to get from one keyframe to another using these principles..<br>**Class 6** Blocking Plus - Blocking alone may not convey enough detail on how the character gets from one moment to another. Utilizing the planning form last lesson we’ll add some additional breakdown poses to help express each motion..<br>**Class 7** Splining - At some point the animation needs to move from its traditional drawings style roots to a lively smooth cg animation. Converting all the animation to splines may smooth the animation but it can also lose some of the liveliness or abruptness. Smoothing the animation, while maintaining the personality, can be a challenge..<br>**Class 8** Refining - With splines comes the odd behaviors, motions that don’t work quite as intended, twisting or flipping and other issues that may need to be changed. Some poses might need to be pushed further to read better so a pass to go back and refine everything is always needed..<br>**Class 9** Polish - In a perfect world your animation might be near completion, but this is where you must get critiques and be honest with yourself and really push for that final 10%. Small secondary actions, gestures, and the likes that make a character feel alive, thinking and feeling..<br>**Class 10** A Brief look into Lipsync and Breakdowns - With our animation complete we’ll take a look at a few actual animations to review our workflow and how these shots might have been accomplished. We’ll also take a moment to look at how this same workflow could be applied to lipsyncing and other areas of animation. |
| [307](https://www.fxphd.com/details/307/) | [FFW1001](https://www.fxphd.com/details/307/) | Resolve Fundamentals | **Class 1** Getting started with Resolve. An introduction to the course with a bit of Warren's background and experience. Loading the software, setting preferences for storage and control surfaces, an overview of the application tabs, and setting up a project so you can start to play..<br>**Class 2** Working with Avid and Final Cut Pro. “We all want to get going and create some great looks but first we need to get our images in and out of Resolve.” We'll get images in manually, using an EDL, or Final Cut Pro XML. Best practices for round-tripping between FCP and Resolve 8, including grading the multi-level timeline. Working with AAF from Avid, including re-linking in Resolve and round tripping back to Avid. For those times when things go wrong, we'll show how to confirm a shot that will not re-link with material in Media Pool..<br>**Class 3** Nodes/Primaries. “The Primary controls are the most important Resolve control you will ever use. If you cannot get a great balance to begin with you will find it so much harder to do the cool stuff down the track.” We'll look at basic node operation, the serial node, waveforms, scopes, and the histogram. In addition, we'll cover the primary controls, auto color, RGB mixer, offsets, YUV corrector, curves, soft white clip and more..<br>**Class 4** Secondary Corrections. “I will show you why we use them, not just how to make them.” This includes fixed six vector secondaries, chroma light @ dark, the picker, keying using the HSL option, and the new V8 secondary hue curves..<br>**Class 5** Power Windows. "Everything I have ever graded had a product of some sort, either a Ford car in a commercial, a leading actor in a movie, or a famous singer in a music clip. You have to make them stand out because that is what your clients will be looking at.” We'll look at Circle and Linear Power windows as well as Poly and Power Curve windows. The tracker is fantastic, but what do you need do do on those occasions when it doesn’t track and you have to manually fix the track? We'll look at auto tracking, manual tracking, fixing broken tracks and image stabilization. You'll also see how to do practical tasks such as tracking cars and people as well has how to track a window off the screen..<br>**Class 6** Advanced Node operation. “The real power of Resolve is truly unleashed when you understand all the nodes and what they do. It took me a while to understand the true power of each of the nodes. When you do it unlocks many creative options”. This class will look at the parallel, layer, and keyer nodes. We'll use these nodes to show how to bring that original product shot color back through your desaturated cool wash. Using the key mixer node, you'll see how to quickly grow a complicated node tree and how to combine keys to make grading faster. PTZR repositioning in the timeline and ALL/COL/PTZR  why this is important to correctly mark our timelines when doing dynamic changes..<br>**Class 7** Conforming, grading, then outputting a film shot on RED. “I always use the Playheads at the start of my session, clients love the interaction of this feature”. We'll conform a short sequence shot on RED using anamorphic lenses and learn how to deal with aspect ratios. Then it's on to render and the formats we can render to, batch request and the render queue, real time proxies/render cache nodes, and wipes and green screen. You'll also see how to create your own effects library of looks with power grades, exporting/importing stills for comparing grades, grouping shots to make grading easier, using playheads to view multiple shots at the same time, and using versioning to easily make alternative grades..<br>**Class 8** Stereo 3D Grading. “Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, Avatar all graded in stereo on Resolve. How hard can it be?” Setting up your project, auto matching tools for both the color and geometry differences between eyes, picture alignment, and the various grading and viewing options for Stereo 3D. We'll also use the difference view to judge and change convergence, determining what comes out of the screen plane or sits behind it, and dealing with questions as to how stereo grading makes you feel physically..<br>**Class 9** Grading Film Digital Material. “Give me a piece of 35mm film shot on a sunny day…a quick adjustment and it looks fabulous. That's not often the case these days. How to get the best out of the new digital formats and what to look out for.” We examine the pros and the cons of digital formats, the controls we have in Resolve, and how to use and create LUTs. In addition, we'll specifically examine formats such as Canon 7D/5D, RED and Epic, Arri Alexa RAW vs. Arri ProRes 444, and the Sony F3..<br>**Class 10** Control Surfaces. “The surfaces supported by Resolve are all very different, try before you buy and find the one that suits you, I guarantee you’ll find it more fun than grading with a mouse” A brief introduction on what the control surface options are and what my own thoughts are on each one. This includes taking a look the BMD Resolve surface, the Tangent Wave, and the Avid Artist and seeing what the buttons and controls do on each panel, customization, connection, shortcuts, and the general feeling of the joyballs and rings. |

| [309](https://www.fxphd.com/details/309/) | [MYA104](https://www.fxphd.com/details/309/) | Introduction to Maya 2012 II | **Class 1** We start with Character Rigging. We begin to explore Maya’s joint system by rigging a cartoon style mouse which we’ll be using for a few classes. We look at how joints can be created and edited, along with Forward Kinematics.<br>**Class 2** We continue with our Character Rigging. We start by looking at IK Handle and IK Spline Handle setups. We then look at the Connection Editor, Expressions and Set Driven Key. From there we attach the Joints to the Mesh using Smooth Bind and start to Paint the Weights of the CV's help help the Mesh and Joints interact properly. Final we look at the Human IK system..<br>**Class 3**: We finish with our Character Rigging project..<br>**Class 4** We start a new two class project looking at nDynamics including nCloth and nParticles. We start the class by building, texturing and lighting our 3D terrain. From there we create a water tower and fill it with particles. We go on to look at the Nucleus Solver and how it affects the particles. Finally we simulate the particles pouring out of the water tower and down the modeled 'dry river bed'..<br>**Class 5** We continue in this class looking at nDynamics..<br>**Class 6** We return to characters in the form of a furry alien. We’ll start off looking at Hair and how to apply it to our pre-built and animated character. We’ll look at how you can control hair with constraints and collision objects, along with various combing techniques. We’ll finish up the class looking at rendering the hair..<br>**Class 7** We move from Hair to Fur. Working with a cat model we’ll look at how Fur works inside of Maya, how it can be edited and how we can animate it. We’ll also look at various styles of Fur such as curly, clumpy, baldness and more. Finally we’ll look at rendering fur and the use of Deep Shadows..<br>**Class 8** We begin our look at Maya’s Fluid Effects. In this first week we’ll focus on various types of Fluid Effects such as cloud, smoke and fire, and how the Fluids can be controlled and made to interact with each other and geometry. We’ll also look at rendering the Fluid effects..<br>**Class 9** Our look at Maya Fluids continues. This week we’ll focus on the Open Water Simulations along with the new Liquid Simulations tool..<br>**Class 10** In the final class we explore Maya 2012’s new plugin DMM (Digital Molecular Matter) which can be used to help you create highly realistic shatter, destruction, and deformation simulations that can include multiple interacting materials. |
| [310](https://www.fxphd.com/details/310/) | [XSI203](https://www.fxphd.com/details/310/) | A Mixed Pipeline with Maya and Mudbox | **Class 1** We cover what a mixed pipeline is, what it’s benefits can be, how cross-app communication has changed over the years, and how it can hinder a production..<br>**Class 2** We start creating a scene in Softimage, creating assets, deciding on scene scale, creating a camera move, etc. We then start transferring data to Maya for creating some other elements that really lets Maya shine using what it is great for. We cover getting the data over to Maya, what transfers, what doesn’t transfer, and what to be careful of..<br>**Class 3** We start creating assets within Maya, we cover the nCloth simulation environment, the fluid simulation for smoke, and check out the camera to make sure it is working with the Softimage camera animation by sending the raw fluid simulation back to Softimage to check alignment (not for rendering)..<br>**Class 4** We cover rendering differences in Maya and Softimage, how their default settings need to be changed to match, how both handle linear color space settings (within the app and for renders) and how to cache the simulations to make it possible to render in a different app than the simulation was created in..<br>**Class 5** Modeling in Softimage and modeling in Maya: what some of the prime differences are (symmetry, user normals, UV’s, extrusions). Sending data from Maya to Mudbox versus sending data from Softimage to Mudbox..<br>**Class 6** Using references: how Maya and Softimage handle them, why they are necessary for some productions, and what to look out for when using them..<br>**Class 7** In this class we cover direct transfer of assets from Maya to Softimage without using the built-in "Send to" tools that Autodesk provides. We cover how to set up a vortex field for the tornado ejecta (papers, wood planks, etc) within Maya, and how to get it in to Softimage to be combined with the Softimage created tornado. We also briefly cover the Animation Mixer, and how to offset cached animation within Softimage..<br>**Class 8** When using the hardware renderer is appropriate, and how it can save time for background elements. We cover hardware rendering in Maya, and how to set up your scene for rendering out hardware elements properly..<br>**Class 9** Bringing all the elements together into (almost) one environment. The models are brought back from Mudbox, the nCloth simulations are brought back from Maya, and the rendered hardware images are brought inside Softimage to check if they line up and to help give the student a sense of what the final will look like..<br>**Class 10** Final fixes to timing may be needed for some of the elements, especially the nCloth speed. We use the built-in non-linear editor for this inside Softimage to slip the start time for the simulations and to adjust the speed. We also briefly cover how it will all get composited together inside of Nuke, giving the students an idea of what they can expect from the end result. |

| [312](https://www.fxphd.com/details/312/) | [HOU204](https://www.fxphd.com/details/312/) | Pyro Effects in Houdini 11 | **Class 1** In class 01 of the HOU204 Pyro FX course, we discuss the overall expectations and the level of experience necessary to get the most from the course. Afterwards, we take a brief tour of the the Fireball, Billowy Smoke, Wispy Smoke and Flames Pyro FX shelf tools, then use the Flames tool to setup a very simple Pyro simulation. We then use this to discuss some of the basics of volume-based fluids such as the fluid container, voxels, fields and solvers. We look at the basic dynamics network that was setup by the shelf tool which included a smoke object, pryo solver, source apply, gravity force and the up-res tools. Then we looked at a simple example of a 2d grid with an image applied to it and how at a low resolution, the image isn't very detailed or accurate but at a higher resolution it becomes much more detailed at accurate. We then apply this concept to a 3D volume and look at the concept of voxels and their importance in determining a high resolution and more accurate simulation versus a low voxel resolution simulation which will have less detailed and not as accurate fluid simulations. Finally we took a look at the DOP I/O SOP that is used to import field data from DOPs to be light, shaded and rendered. Which also led to a brief discussion on the Volume Visualization SOP that is used to modify the viewport representation of our field data. The rendered geometry however is set to the DOP I/O SOP which has a Pyro Shader applied to it, which will get used to shade the object to look like smoke and fire..<br>**Class 2** Introduce the Pyro FX shelf tools. This includes the Fireball, Billowy Smoke, Wispy Smoke and Flames. Discuss in great detail the the Smoke Object, Pyro Solver and the Source Apply. Use the Smoke Object to define the fluid container, initial States, Wind Tunnel and Boundary conditions. Then use the custom visualization options to view the important fields. Discuss some conflicts between the Source Apply and the Pyro Solver's Source emission parameters. Define an emission source and apply animated noise to it to get more interesting emission results. Investigate how Temperature effects buoyancy causing fluids to rise or fall..<br>**Class 3** Simplify the Billowy Smoke simulation. Use this as a base to build upon to get a better understanding of how each parameter truly effects the Pyro simulation. Begin an in-depth look at the Pyro Solver. Start exploring the basic properties of the fluid such as viscosity, cooling rate and vortex confinement. Add turbulence to create more interesting motion in the smoke. Explore the difference between Seeding vorticles and using Vortex Confinement to introduce spinning swirly motion in the fluid. Then use diffusion to blur the temperature, density or fuel fields over time. Use Motion FX to add animated noise to the initial velocity of the smoke. Then discuss the use of the Forces parameters in the Pyro Solver for global scaling control over all forces in the Pyro simulation..<br>**Class 4** The combustion model used for creating fire and smoke. This allows fuel to ignite and create fire. The burning can release heat, gas, soot and smoke. Use the Fireball and Flames tools to assist in the exploration. Compare the differences in the Pyro setup for smoke and fire. Explore how to catch dynamics objects on fire..<br>**Class 5** Learn to paint attributes such as fuel and temperature in SOPs. Then use these attributes to drive a Pyro simulation. Afterwords take a quick look at how to use RBD objects to ignite fuel on fire..<br>**Class 6** Explore how DOPs Forces can be used to effect the behavior of the Pyro simulation. We'll discuss some of the more commonly used forces such as wind, uniform force, noise field, vortex and magnet. Look at how to setup a simple smoke stack effect..<br>**Class 7** A brief tour of lighting, shading and rendering smoke and fire. This will include looking at the Material Shader Builder and the Pyro Shader. Then we'll talk about guidelines for rendering volumetrics in Mantra to get an efficient and high quality result render..<br>**Class 8** We'll use the Pyro FX shelf tools to automatically setup a Pyro simulation with Up Res Pyro tools. Then we'll have a brief discussion how to take the base simulation and upres it into a much higher resolution, more detailed looking pyro simulation..<br>**Class 9** Custom velocity fields in SOPs to artistically direct the fluid motion in DOPs. We'll look at multiple methods for creating the velocity fields and different ways to make use of this in DOPs. It will require a discussion and use of the Field Force, SOP Geometry, SOP Vector Field, Vector Field, Vector Field Visualization, Gas Particle to Field, Gas Calculate, Gas Diffuse and Gas Dissipate..<br>**Class 10** All of the Pyro simulations were required to exist inside a pre-defined fluid container. In this final class, we'll look at a method to automatically resize the fluid container so that the Pyro simulation can move freely anywhere in the scene. Next we'll look at different methods for post-processing the simulation with Houdini's volume tools. Artistically sculpting and manipulating the data without needing to re-simulate the entire simulation from scratch will be invaluable. With all of these tools, you should be able to quickly and effectively create whatever fluid effect you'll want! Introduce the idea of burning a piece of paper. Setup an automatically resizing fluid container so that the Pyro simulation is free to move where it wants. |
| [313](https://www.fxphd.com/details/313/) | [MOG204](https://www.fxphd.com/details/313/) | Typography in Title Design | **Class 1** A brief look at key sequences and movie titles, with a specific slant on graphical and typographic milestones. Everyone has their favourites- and indeed their dislikes. These are ones Mark thinks really contributed to our current rich titles pool..<br>**Class 2** We complete our brief journey through the 'greats' of title design, before taking a detailed look at Optical Flares - an essential part of a designer's toolkit. Using Flares, Mark completes the typography and title reveals for 'The Sheik' end promo..<br>**Class 3** Can you say you 'trust' a font? We look at several different examples showing how different type faces create different moods or interpretations in title sequences, when set. Some fonts may say 'comedy'; others 'thriller'... We hone in on a suitably 'trustworthy' font, one appropriate, perhaps, for wildlife documentary titles....<br>**Class 4** We kick off the first of our real world title briefs. Mark meets Carlos Ledesma, the director of 'Incendia', and talks about the brief for the titles for this sequence. We also look at combining optical flares with other bundled AE effects to create a finished title string..<br>**Class 5** How to choose and find your font: Mark takes us across several online type foundries looking for a fresh typeface for the "Incendia" titles. We look at different characteristics and traits of various possible fonts before closing in on a new release which is a strong choice for the project. We "road test" it prior to purchase.<br>**Class 6** We take a look at some of the footage that we have specially shot for out title sequences. First up, we try several different fonts, and look at ways to use "white space" around an actor's face, or picture composition, to enhance the typography..<br>**Class 7** We return to the Incendia/ Fire Dance project. We look at the different impact on type changing the title's words create, as well as ways to combine other fonts on the same screen effectively. Finally a brief overview of 'Form', as we begin to animate the completed Fire Dance typography..<br>**Class 8** We continue our look at Form and Particular, as we apply motion to several of the title designs for the 'Fire Dance' project..<br>**Class 9** We look around Final Cut as we work up titles that appear in between and over a new Pool Table dialogue sequence. Plus, more ideas and treatments for Title logos for "Hustler.".<br>**Class 10** We complete the course by looking at a specific title sequence for the 'pool table' footage, where the title 'writes on', and incorporates close-up shots of the balls on the table. Finally we look at 'Robert' and design the opener for this short film, and also look at cutting-out letters and illustrations for a large paste board, in an analogue fashion, for Robert's credit sequence. |

We will also look at a method to use parametric objects rather than polygonal objects..<br>**Class 3** Using Particle Groups. This week we cover the principles of working with Particle Groups, starting out with a simple example to introduce the concept, we then move on and build two more in depth examples. This covers assigning particles to specific groups, moving particles from one group to another based on conditions we define or events that occur in the scene..<br>**Class 4** Particles interacting with objects. Using PFollowPosition to move particles onto surfaces and into volumes. More on moving particles between groups based on expression criteria. Making particles look at or target other objects based on distance..<br>**Class 5** Particle Collision.

Particle on particle collision taking mass into account. Moving particles across a surface..<br>**Class 6** Particle Spawning. Creating particles from particles. We examine two methods; one which uses PAge to trigger particle emitters and create fireworks, the other uses Plight to trigger new and kill existing particles..<br>**Class 7** Particle Fragmentation. Methods to break your particles into more particles. Starting with the rather quirky PBlurp and moving on to the more practical PFragment. We end with an example of using these nodes to dissolve an object into particles..<br>**Class 8** This week we explore various methods of emitting multiple objects. Using Xpresso, Python and MoGraph. We look at cloning on to particles and following a spline with and without deformation.

| [317](https://www.fxphd.com/details/317/) | [RTO202](https://www.fxphd.com/details/317/) | Tools of Roto and Paint | **Class 1** Introduction to the Philosophy of Roto. It's important to establish the set of principles we will be working with throughout the course. What constitutes a "good roto"? What are the main tools and why do we favour a certain approach with some shots? In this session we will be creating rotoshapes to use for a beauty retouch session..<br>**Class 2** Beauty retouch. Continuing from the last session, we put the shapes to use to do some beauty retouch work. We look at natural looking skin-smoothing techniques that do not compromise texture or create a plasticky surface. We repurpose last class's work to reshape the features of our subject..<br>**Class 3** Dissecting a roto. Simple roto requires simple shapes. Complex roto requires lots of simple shapes! Managing these is a challenge and the basis for huge time-savings. We look at a mixture of soft and hard objects, and how to approach edge consistency, motion blur and out of focus elements..<br>**Class 4** Building a depth map - rotoscoping buildings. Rotoscoping still objects should be easy. Camera movements, perspective changes and lens distortion all help to make these jobs harder. Again, planning and using the right tools to fix these problems, makes a painful shot a lot easier to handle..<br>**Class 5** Car pack shot - Bringing things up a notch now and pushing our planar tracking forward. We've got a moving subject, a moving camera and a tight deadline. Where are the best places to spend our time tracking and at what point do we decide to get in to manual rotoscoping work? We also take a look at stabilization and how to effectively use it..<br>**Class 6** Background enhancement. Following from the previous lesson, we look at 3D tracking and how this can speed up certain roto tasks. We also put these results together with the car shape to add more impact to an ordinary background..<br>**Class 7** Background cleanup. This is another two-part lesson. In the first section we look at creating cleanplates, simple wire removal and some more complex motion tracking..<br>**Class 8** Wire removal - Some wire removals are relatively straightforward. In this lesson we take a look at how to handle a wire removal through semi-transparent fabric, motion blur and hair. We start in NukeX and the Furnace Wire Removal effect to do the heavy lifting, before moving on to finessing the fine details..<br>**Class 9** Cleanplates - In this lesson we discuss grain management strategies for cleanplates, including how to create a smooth cleanplate from noisy footage. The second half of the lesson looks at generating larger plates from B-roll video footage and when we can cheat a bit with rig removal..<br>**Class 10** Procedural mattes, the shortcut to avoiding rotoscoping. In this session we finish off the shot from the previous lesson, improving on the track and bringing our character back over the removed rig. We explore different types of procedural mattes, including regular keyers and channel combinations. For the ultimate roto avoidance technique, we move back to SilhouetteFX and work quickly in the Power Matte node and see how easy it is to tweak the results in After Effects. To finish off the course, we take a final look at how frame-by-frame Paint is an unavoidable tool in some circumstances but how we limit its use. |

To warm for the course, we're going to tackle the easiest shot , creating the atmospheric promo image with our female hero standing on a cliff high above the clouds. This will cover the creation of the cliffs in Vue before exporting to Mudbox for some higher res detailing and the creation of the dense cloud layer. The shot will be tweaked if we need to so that it fits with the final locked down script..<br>**Class 2** The Photoreal Tree Lined Road Part 1. This lesson will cover the creation of a full 3d tree lined photo real road plate, starting out by creating the custom tree in Vue and how we can use other applications such as Autodesk Mudbox to vastly improve our final result above and beyond usual Vue quality..<br>**Class 3** The Photoreal Tree Lined Road Part 2. Continuing on from the last lesson, after finishing off our scene we'll be moving onto lighting the whole scene and showing my own way to quickly get our lighting right. Then it's time to sort out all the passes we need to export ready for use..<br>**Class 4** Joan of Arc: Shot list Matte #1. This lesson will be creating the first of the photoreal scenes from the final locked down script. This could be a scene containing anything from set extension to a full 3D shot or match move..<br>**Class 5** Joan of Arc: Shot list Matte #2. This will be the creation of our 2nd photoreal scene needed from the final shot lists. Again at this stage we don't know what these are going to be, this all depends on the final script and shot list. Should the shot be something simple we'll also be creating 'filler shots' completely in 3D for the story..<br>**Class 6** Detailed Water Scene / Joan of Arc: Shot Light Matte #3. To cover as much ground as possible we'll also be covering the creation this week of a detailed scene that includes water in the shot and show how we can sculpt things that will make our live easier in external applications such as Mudbox. Should there be a 3rd (or more) matte shot on our shot list to do, we will do these instead of the Water Scene this week..<br>**Class 7** The Epic Lighting Week. We concentrate on lighting and we'll take the same scene of a castle in a dense valley and show different ways we can light both night and day and different seasons. As an extra we'll show ways we can get the one pass missing from Vue...the cloud pass. We'll create its own depth and alpha pass to enable fine tweaking at compositing level later..<br>**Class 8** Joan of Arc: Cathedral External Match Moved Shot Part 1. Continuing on from the interior shots created in MOD301, for this lesson we'll start tackling our main scene with the big cathedral external reveal which needs us to match all lighting and materials to a shot with no HDRI available. So we'll start by importing our tracking data into 3DSMax and blocking out the positions for everything before sending it for approval by our art director in time for the next lesson..<br>**Class 9** Joan of Arc: Cathedral External Match Moved Shot Part 2. Making any changes that have been requested we'll import everything into Vue and add final materials and lighting, add any extra set dressing and test our final composite..<br>**Class 10** Joan of Arc: Last Minute Shots / Tips and tricks. As well as catching up on any last minute shots that have been handed to us at the last minute we'll cover a healthy dose of tips and tricks to help get out of sticky situations on a full 3D Matte as well as go back over what we've done in previous weeks and answer any outstanding questions. |

Then we get to planning it - analyzing the project, laying out all the steps towards the end result and the thought process behind them..<br>**Class 2** Dealing with with the primary cut of the big earth pieces and building a system to animate them in Thinking Particles. Good fragmentation practices, setting up useful animation controls and versioning the animation get covered..<br>**Class 3** We use the main animation we have prepared and cut the pieces once more, to get detail on the edges. Then we look at implementing the second level simulation on top of the first level one, retaining the underlying motions and adding detail..<br>**Class 4** Working on the third level simulation, where fragments are small enough so we can use procedural fragmentation with VolumeBreaker.

| [330](https://www.fxphd.com/details/330/) | [RND202](https://www.fxphd.com/details/330/) | RenderMan Techniques in Production | **Class 1** Procedural Variation - Part 1.<br>**Class 2** Procedural Variation - Part 2.<br>**Class 3** Image Based Lighting - Part 1.<br>**Class 4** Taking off from lesson 3 (Image Based Lighting, Part 1), we continue on the topics of Image Based Lighting and Physically Based Shading. We introduce the concept of Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS), where we define importance sampling both the the material BRDF and the physically-based light sources. Moving on, we look at the actual implementation of our concepts in PRMan16+ (16, 17, …) with the new "Physically Plausible Shading" paradigm introduced in PRman16; this includes the new pipeline methods of lighting(), diffuselighting(), and specularlighting(). We render some physically based glass with the factory shipped glass.rib in PRMan, and look into our own physically based scene with our van and our unclipped HDR light sources. In our own scene we achieve our goal of rendering diffuse with no artifacts from a raw unclipped HDR map. Inside our RIB file we go through the new physically plausible shaders (plausibleMatte, plausibleDielectric, plausibleConductor, and plausibleEnvlight)..<br>**Class 5** Continuing on from our last lesson, we use our Physically-Plausible scene in multiple lighting environments to demonstrate how our ONE material setup holds across ALL lighting environments. We then look at how a clipped HDR, or incorrect lighting environment, always leads to material settings that fail to hold across multiple different lighing environments. Thus we argue that you can't "fully tune" a material using the old traditional methods of clipped HDR's and non-Physically-Plausible shading. To gain a deeper understanding of our shading, we explore the details of our plausibleMatte, plausibleDielectric, and other plausible shaders in our scene. We also look at the Fresnel coefficient and how that mixes between our diffuse and specular sampling inside our plauisbleDielectric shader. Finally, we introduce the workflow of cutting out the unclipped sun in 32-bit mode from our HDR texture, and placing it onto an arealight instead - something we will continue in the next lesson..<br>**Class 6** We continue with our Physically Plausible Shading, and Image Based Lighting project. We move onto the topics of cutting out super bright spots from our HDR and placing it onto an arealight, using the plausibleSunlight shader, and placing it onto another plausibleEnvlight. In our exploration we notice pros and cons of each approach, and look at the shaders and RIB file implementation..<br>**Class 7** We continue with our Physically Plausible Shading, and Image Based Lighting project. We cover related Ray Tracing topics such as sampling the hemisphere related to cone angle and solid angle. We do a "furnace test" on our scene to confirm normalized BRDF's and energy conservation in our materials and lights..<br>**Class 8** We start on a new topic, procedurally generated noise patterns for specific techniques in production. This technique can be used for many organic patterns found in nature, we look at a complex ocean shader first in this lesson. We start off with a render of our ocean scene, compare renders with the different noise layers, and talk about the concept of the noise functions, as well as sine and cosine patterns for our base layer ocean. Then we spend some time in Houdini going over our scene, the shader setup for both surface and displacement, and the parameters in the shaders. Finally we look at the concept of modifying our noise call to create a "Sharp Crested" noise layer by applying absolute value calls, inverting and offsetting our noise function..<br>**Class 9** We continue with our project in procedural noise patterns for our ocean surface and displacement shader. We go step by step through some of the displacement parameters we talked about in the last lesson, and render with changes in each parameter, looking at both the coreocean displacement and the sharp-crested displacement. We look at the source code for a basic FBM layered fractal noise, as well as our modified one we use in the ocean displacement. We also talk about some of the dicing strategy options in PRMan and displacement bound attribute..<br>**Class 10** In this final lesson of our procedural noise shading section, we continue with our ocean scene. We introduce procedurally generated "whitecaps" to our ocean that are generated based on the vectors of the individual noise layers. We look at a final render animation with the whitecaps, then overview the shader parameters in our Houdini scene, and go into a lesson on the vector math that drives the shading. We also look at our "noise time" parameter for animating our sharpcrests displacement layer. In addition we look at how these very same techniques can be used to simulate other patterns in nature such as snow, and we look at a snow shader with its corresponding renders, as well as the parameters in a Houdini scene. |

Taking cues from Photoshop's layer palette, the Shader Tree allows us to quickly apply, create and edit the materials and textures in our scene. We'll explore the basic order of operation within the shader tree and learn how to create advanced surface attributes, like glass..<br>**Class 4** We'll wrap up our first project with an in-depth look at the lighting and rendering system in Modo. We should have a firm understanding of the different lights and cameras available for us in Modo as well as basic rendering pipeline..<br>**Class 5** The next project in this course will focus in the interactive painting system in Modo. Before we can paint on our model, we need to create a series of distortion free UV Maps for a production-ready model of cannon.

We then learn how to navigate Nuke's 3D view, lock the camera and set the ground plane. Finally, we venture into the joys of rotomation by assigning an arbitrary plane to a segment of the point cloud data, then use the ol' faithful RotoPaint node to roto in 3D..<br>**Class 2** We introduce the concept of UV maps and segue into their indispensable nature for compositors. We then cleanplate our trusty old bench scene using UV mapped planes and discover that when you take a camera and stick a light source in it, you get a projector. A.K.A. camera projection mapping..<br>**Class 3** We discover how to track a moving object and then use NukeX's modeler tool to create guide geometry for more elaborate modeling to be done outside of Nuke. We then export our point cloud solve and guide geometry to Luxology's modo via fbx. Finally we get an accelerated orientation to the modo interface and toolset, along with an introduction to subdivision surface modeling. Whew. When you're done, head to the fridge and grab yourself a cold one, you'll have earned it..<br>**Class 4** We start in modo, learning some very basic box modeling techniques with subdivision surfaces, to create some matching geometry for our face model. We then head over to Nuke where we use the projection solver node to align the object to camera, then do a little tweaking with expressions to align the scene solve camera to the projection solver cam. Then we throw in a light and relight our talking head..<br>**Class 5** We launch into the core course project in this class: making someone turn to cloth, then evaporate into particles. We begin with a full solve with lens distortion removal for the shot, then use the modeler tool along with dueling cameras to create an animated cleanplate for the sequence..<br>**Class 6** We create an animated model of the girl we plan to collapse into cloth. We start with a primitive created in Nuke, refine in modo, then setup a UV map for projection mapping. Finally we take a crash course in the bullet dynamics physics engine..<br>**Class 7** We create the cloth simulation to collapse a girl to cloth, and set up an image-based lighting pass to match the basic scene lighting. We are working with vertex maps and a basic shadow rig along the way..<br>**Class 8** We wrap the disappearing girl shot with particles flying everywhere thanks to P maps (position maps), particles, vortexes and directional forces. We also work with multiple lighting passes to examine the workflow for neutralizing on-set lighting and replacing it with IBL lighting.

| [343](https://www.fxphd.com/details/343/) | [RND301](https://www.fxphd.com/details/343/) | Production Shader Writing Fundamentals & Physically Plausible Shading | **Class 1** In the first lesson of this course, we outline the shader building blocks we will be covering in the next few lessons, as well as the different types of shaders used in production. We explore an overview graph of where a shader fits into our rendering pipeline, then proceed to implement each stage from scratch: we build a simple shader, and insert it into a basic RIB file in a text editor, then render in PRMan from the command-line. We then take the same shader and run it through Houdini where we build a scene from scratch and go over every step to get the Renderman shader and Output Driver running. We also look at the RIB file that Houdini generates and compare it with our basic one that was created manually. Next we want to run the same shader through Renderman Studio 4 (RMS) in Maya to see the same render, and the steps required to get it there. We also explore the realtime re-rendering technology in RMS with our scene, and look at the RIB file generated by RMS..<br>**Class 2** We follow up on the surface shader workflow with a displacement shader workflow. We describe the concept of the vector math behind displacement shaders, create a very simple displacement shader, and go through the source code line by line discussing the process. We compile our shader and load it into a simple Houdini scene where we attach it to our geometry and render to see the displaced geometry. We also examine the RIB file generated by Houdini and render that manually through a shell terminal..<br>**Class 3** We take off from the previous lesson's simple surface and displacement shader examples into some fundamental building blocks of production shaders. We introduce the topics of loops, functions, define's, message passing between surface and displacement shaders, ST co-ordinates and their relationship to the texture() call, and texture reading. We do this on the backdrop of building up a procedural and texture based snow shader, where we use all these building blocks, as well as our imgFile shader..<br>**Class 4** We continue on with our production shader writing fundamentals, and explore Arbitrary Output Variables (AOVs), as well as Surface Normals and the Viewing Vector. We build on our snow shader scene and define what exactly needs to go in our snow surface shader to define our custom AOVs, and the corresponding declaration in the RIB file. We then load our scene in Houdini and declare the AOVs there, and render them out to see all the different passes. To explore surface normals and the viewing vector, we use an Oren Nayar Diffuse illumination in our snow shader and show the creation of the V vector, and how its used within the diffuse illumination by dot products and cross products of the vectors..<br>**Class 5** PRMan & Houdini "Crash Course".<br>**Class 6** By popular demand on the forums for this topic (thanks for all that expressed interest), we've added a new topic for just this lesson, where we explore and implement "Procedural Wear" with dust/scratches/rust/dirt/etc placement onto our models. I developed a complex shader on the feature film "Mars Needs Moms" for Disney using these techniques, and we build up our shader and scene with this workflow using an edge detection shader and ambient occlusion to drive our masks for dirt/scratches/rust/etc textures..<br>**Class 7** In this lesson we move onto Physically Plausible Shading and Co-Shaders. We define a Physical Plausible Shading System and the important fundamentals within it, including energy conservation, physical material properties, and physically based lights. For implementation of that system, we explore importance sampling and raytracing concepts. In our Physically Plausible scene, we explore the plausible surface shaders and lights, render our RIB file, and examine the source code of the plausibleDielectric shader. Exploring the Physically Plausible system leads us to writing co-shaders (or class-based shaders, shader objects): we define co-shaders and Object Oriented Programming, why they are used, and compare the source code to traditional shaders that ultimately do the same functionality in our example, but the co-shaders are more modular and have more efficient message/variable passing, as we will see in future lessons..<br>**Class 8** In this lesson we continue on with Class-based shaders and Co-shaders, and Physically Plausible Shading. Taking off from our class based shader created in the previous lesson, we create two small co-shaders to really illustrate the modularity of a co-shader paradigm and how those co-shaders plug into our main Shader Object, and how they all work together in the RIB file with "handles". We distinguish between "Shader Objects", "methods" inside Shader Objects, and "co-shaders". Having those fundamentals allows us to re-examine the Physically Plausible Shaders in PRMan and see the Shader Objects and method calls, and we specifically look at what the new pipeline methods lighting(), diffuselighting(), and specularlighting(). But using PRMan's new Physically Plausible Shading is not the only way to implement a co-shader Physically Based paradigm, many studios have created their own using co-shaders even before PRMan16 where Physically Plausible Shading was introduced as part of the renderer: we outline a custom co-shader Physically Based System and see what the RIB file looks like including the BRDF's and Integrator - this is a high level concept of the entire system with RIB implementation. Finally, how does the artist or technical director work with these kinds of co-shaders in production? We show a typical node-based UI mockup of connecting different BRDF's into a final integrator (or sometimes called Collector) and how the modularity really shines when we can write our own co-shader BRDF's and plug them in..<br>**Class 9** With Shader Objects, Co-shaders, and the Physically Plausible Shading system in PRMan in our toolbelts, we look at ways we can extend and customize our Physically Based system. One of the things we can modify in our existing system of shaders and lights is the BRDF - we can customize existing BRDF's, or add our own. Where do we begin if we want to extend or add our own BRDF's? We distill the plausibleDielectric shader and look at the Lambertian Diffuse and Ashikhmin-Shirley Specular BRDF's, how they are used in plausibleDielectric, and their corresponding header files. From there we create our own myDiffBRDF header file with our own struct, and modify the BRDF computation slightly, show how this plugs into the main shader, and do a render to compare the results on our scene. Moving onto a more complex BRDF that we want to implement, we look at the Oren-Nayer Diffuse model that we've used with our snow shader earlier in this course, and convert that from a traditional RSL1 shader into our RSL2 Physically Based Shader Object system: this requires a number of conversions of vectors, normals, and light looping to work with our system, which we successfully do and plug into our Physically Plausible scene and do a few renders with different diffuse roughness settings of our new BRDF. With knowledge of this workflow, we have what we need to add any kind of BRDF we want into our system..<br>**Class 10** After a number of lessons focused on shader writing with Shader Objects and Co-Shaders, modifying and writing our own BRDF's, this lesson focuses on using those shaders in RendermanStudio's raytraced re-renderer. As mentioned in the intro to this course, we wanted to spend one lesson rendering in the raytraced renderer since the technology is such a great tool and provides instantaneous visual feedback as we modify our lights, shaders, and camera - this is a great way to wrap up our physically based section of the course where we get to really see the shaders and lights in action. |

We go over the concerns of why conversion and make an argument for conversion over native stereo. We also examine the different concepts behind what makes for a good conversion..<br>**Class 2** We further examine the fundamentals of good stereo conversion. We look into how to define different types of stereo conversion techniques, classify the types of shots that are good to convert and which work better as a 2nd unit or pick up with a native stereo crew..<br>**Class 3** Breaking down a shot and Depth scripting. We look at a sequence and talk about how 3D needs to flow from one shot to the next. Create a depth script that describes how a shots depth should be evaluated, and then go on to break a shot down into its layers. We learn how to mark a shot up to hand it off to a depth artist..<br>**Class 4** Clean Plating techniques. Many shots can be broken into layers that require back filling and pixel reconstruction. We look at some techniques to add pixels back into areas that will be voided by the displaced pixels..<br>**Class 5** We rotoscope our shot and we look at techniques to add form and shape to the rotos. This is a key area to great conversions. You have to add volume and form in the right places to give the correct sense of depth..<br>**Class 6** Now we will use object tracking to add volume and fill for complex shapes. If we roto the outside edge of an object or use an object from green screen and then fill its volume with a 3D tracked object that has a more generalized shape for the volume, we can get a lot of value in our 3D shapes..<br>**Class 7** In many productions that shoot native 3D, there are shots that fail. Issues that can cause a shot to fail can be the convergence is too wide, color and polarization failures, or camera malfunctions. In "Stereoscopic Triage" We learn how to take a broken shot, evaluate what parts can be reused or saved, and then repair and fix them..<br>**Class 8** We will use 3D projections, tracking and Nuke 7's object point cloud generator to generate depth maps. We will also look at procedural depth map generating using Nuke 7's new depth generator node, and build a stereoscopic camera rig to render displaced geometry to generate new eyes..<br>**Class 9** We take NUKE 7's Model Builder Node to assist creating depth maps for a wide shot. We can use the geo to shape and add volume to shots with hard surfaces. We also learn about creating depth and conversion using Pixel Farms PFdepth which excels at complex organic shots..<br>**Class 10** We will revisit our shots and complete them. Then we take a look at a Close up shot. Talking head shots are the corner stone of all films. Fine hair details and getting the most out of the facial structure and what details you use and don't can make your shot. |

| [359](https://www.fxphd.com/details/359/) | [MDO102](https://www.fxphd.com/details/359/) | Introduction to modo, Part 2 | **Class 1** Over the course of this coure we work on the modeling, texturing, rigging and rendering of an antique steam locomotive. We start off by focusing on a few of the advanced modeling features in Modo. Specifically, we explore how to use Pixar Sub-Division Surfaces and their role in the larger, production pipeline..<br>**Class 2** In today's modern production environment, creating a high resolution 3D sculpture is made possible with the advent of ZBrush and Mudbox. These applications allow sculptors to create 3D models with millions and millions of polygons; something we cannot necessarily work with in traditional 3D packages. We need to lower the resolution of these meshes so that they can efficiently be applied into the Modo pipeline. The Retopology tools in Modo will help us wrangle high-resolution geometry and get our models to a useable state for rendering. We explore the "Topo" tab in Modo and learn how to apply the Retopology tools to our scene..<br>**Class 3** One of the most powerful features in Modo are Replicators. Let's jump into the world of Replicators and dig deep into how to work with replicators, how to efficiently apply them to our scene and the many possible applications of this exciting technology..<br>**Class 4** We focus on detailing the back end of the coal car by learning how to leverage the power of Recoil in Modo. We combine Modo's replicator system with Recoil to quickly add the illusion of small pieces of coal in the back of our train..<br>**Class 5** It is time to get our train moving! We explore the mechanical rigging system inside of Modo. Specifically, we take a look at how to create relationships between the Mesh Items by generating a series of position, direction and rotation constraints for the wheels of the train..<br>**Class 6** Assemblies, in Modo, allow us to create complex relationships between different items, objects and channels. In addition, we can package Assemblies together and create a system that can be easily duplicated in the scene. We look at how we can use the nodal workflow of the Assembly Area to make the rigging pipeline more efficient, powerful and accurate for our train wheels..<br>**Class 7** Once you master the art of creating Replicators, you won't want to stop using them! This week, we extend our working knowledge of Replicators by using them to create the trees and train tracks in our environment. In addition, we also explore how we can add random variations to our trees, rocks and bushes with Replicators..<br>**Class 8** At the core of Modo resides an extremely powerful Hair and Fur system. Let's jump in and take a look at how we can apply the Modo Hair and Fur system to create the illusion of grass for our train's environment..<br>**Class 9** We wrap up the production of our environment by looking at how we can apply the Texture Bombing system to quickly add subtle variations to the textures in our environment..<br>**Class 10** No train is complete without a plume of smoke rising from its smoke stack! We finish by exploring Modo's particle painting system and volumetric effects (clouds and smoke)!. |

Start finding the base surface properties of the shaders we will be needing. Do not worry too much about colors, textures and precision yet. Lets get the overall reaction to light working well. Using the blend and SSS shaders along with the vray material. Build some nice base shaders for us. Look into using displacements and normal mapping where applicable. The base shaders will be a skin shader, a cloth shader and an extra items shader. Redo the turntable to reflect where we are at. Commenting on turntable to see what needs changing and what we need to remember to address in the next weeks. I will be commenting on the students turntables, acting like a client, a somewhat pleasant client though..<br>**Class 4** Setup arbitrary outputs for look development and take the work into nuke to keep refining before going back to maya and cleaning up. Tips on working with the temp images from maya to make faster iterations. Start locking down the base shaders before adding textures. A discussion on achieving different looks and presenting them to end up with something we and the client both like. Students should be handing in different options for some of the shaders for comments..<br>**Class 5** Start painting textures. Use the terrific new psd features in nuke to create automated outputs of your textures from one psd file. On a technical note. Use the switch node from vray to use several textures with just a few main shaders to stay lean and efficient. Discussion of level of detail and layers in textures to make the world seem consistent. Discussion about UVs vs ptex and why we love ptex but stay with UVs for this project..<br>**Class 6** Further our lookdev. Fine tune shaders, displacements and so on. Make it look good in render and preliminary comping. Set up a lighting rig we like. Brief discussion of different lighting setups from the real world. Setup a vray scene with different light rigs, including hdri, flat and simple and something that resembles what look we want from the scene. Students should show off their results for comments..<br>**Class 7** Start setting up arbitrary passes that will be used in the final scene, while going back and forth into nuke. Complete the lookdev and start turning it into production. The aim is to get it as right as possible from the renderer, without over complicating things. I like stuff to be pragmatic and lightweight. Making the changes from last weeks comments. It is now time for the students to show their final look development..<br>**Class 8** The complete nuke script. Setting up a nice and clean nuke script for our compositors, making sure everything pipes in nicely and that the controls needed are well exposed and easy to use. Make sure maya writes out the formats we want, to the destinations we want. Clean up and rinse the scene. The tedious job of cleaning and naming..<br>**Class 9** In this class we take all that we have learned and built over the last eight classes and create an asset from the character. We will clean up everything and set up a system for creating shot scenes to render with all the right render passes set up automatically..<br>**Class 10** In the final class we go through a few things to do to make your renders look nicer and removing flicker in nuke. Lastly there is a rundown of what we have done over the last ten weeks. |

We then dive in and create our first tree from scratch, exploring on the way the basic concepts and workflow of procedural plant modeling..<br>**Class 2** Leaves require a fine balancing act between detail and poly count, and in this lesson we'll look closely at two different approaches. First we create a ground ivy plant using meshes and have it grow on the surface of rocks, then we create palm leaves using fronds..<br>**Class 3** Moving on to a more advanced technique for creating complex leaves structures like conifer needles, we build external meshes in Maya, while using SpeedTree as a texture generator rather than using photos or scans. We then explore manual editing and brush paint modeling techniques..<br>**Class 4** Textures are crucial in plant creation, and we take a look at techniques for generating suitable displacement, specular and normal maps (and check out some useful tools for that). Then we dig deep into the sophisticated wind generator, using both grass and trees to check its parameters. Finally, we create vines around the trunk using mesh attraction..<br>**Class 5** Now that we've covered a variety of plant modeling techniques, we start building our environment shot. In this lesson we'll use Vue to create base elements such as terrains, rocks and HDR sky, create a layout and camera in Maya and bring is all into SpeedTree..<br>**Class 6** This lesson will be devoted to creating the foreground hero tree, ivy climbing on the truck and ground ivy, using a combination of mesh, zone, and directional forces..<br>**Class 7** We now move to Maya, looking at the SpeedTree to Maya export/import process and using point caches for wind animation. In Maya, we first tweak the plant shaders then set up the lighting using the Vue sky..<br>**Class 8** We leave our shot aside for this class to take a sneak peak at e-on's brand new Plant Factory. While it shares many concepts with SpeedTree, it also offers some unique features (in addition to the obvious integration with Vue), and we take a close look at those..<br>**Class 9** Back to the shot. We create additional 3D plants and background trees to populate the scene, then set up render layers and render passes for compositing..<br>**Class 10** Time to render out the full frame range for the necessary passes. This lesson is done mainly in Nuke. We add depth to the environment using a combination of fog, volumetric light and grading, using different render passes. |

We have a look at the plates, the model and brief. The important part of the lesson is getting everything set up and ready for action, with a clear goal in mind..<br>**Class 2** On set work. What was covered when shooting. Calibrating the plates and putting together the hdri image that we will be using. We look at getting the environment standin built, and using the hdri to texture this. At the end of the lesson, we have an environment set up and ready to go..<br>**Class 3** First off there is a quick introduction to de-lensing the plates, and getting them tracked, including a workflow for re-applying the lens distortion. It's then time to render a nice grey helicopter in the shot to see that all is working as we expect it to..<br>**Class 4** With all that in place, it's time to start making the chopper look real! Step one is getting a decent metal material in there, and getting our bump and displacements working..<br>**Class 5** Next step in shading the helicopter is to get basic colors on there, as well working on speculars and reflections, which will really sell the shot. After this lesson, the helicopter should feel like it is actually in the shot!.<br>**Class 6** Time for color. We start adding color and decals to the bird. This will involve going back to our spec and bump maps, making sure we can 'feel' the difference in surface qualities..<br>**Class 7** Dirty her up. We add weathering, wear and tear. This also includes scratches, exhaust burns, dust and other good forces of nature that has played a part in the helicopters life. We are now entering realism!.<br>**Class 8** Peter was once told by a supervisor on a show he worked on: "now it looks real... go ahead and make it look good". This is what we do now. Add kick lights, bounces, and everything else we can come up with..<br>**Class 9** We do a comp of the shot now, and figure out what plates we need to add in there to really sell it. We then shoot those in the studio and comp them in! This could also include rendering out particles for exhaust pipes and other details..<br>**Class 10** Finishing the shot! Get the last elements in there. Touch up the plate. Camera shake. Grain. etc... they are all our friends!. |

We start by looking at the shots we will be working on, then the main workflow. We then talk about HDRI Lighting vs. Localised HDRI Lighting before doing some practical work in Maya. We then talk about the main Templete file we will be using in Katana before moving into Katana itself. A bonus video helps to explain how to load a Katana template..<br>**Class 2** In our second class we look at preparing the main environments. We start by looking at the camera track of the kitchen done in Syntheyes, from there we export the tracking data from Nuke into Maya where we set up the correct camera back and Image Plane. Next we bring in the high resolution geometry of the kitchen to see how it fits with the tracking data. Then we return to Nuke and using ModelBuilder we rough out some basic geometry for the kitchen and then bring that back into Maya. Finally we talk about light placements..<br>**Class 3** Our third class starts with importing the pre-build Alembic cache of our main character. From here we assign its geometry into various Collection sets before building some basic shaders and assigning them to the geometry. Finally we build a basic Lighting Rig and run some test renders to make sure everything is working correctly..<br>**Class 4** In our fourth class we start by looking at Physically Plausible Shaders and Lights using RenderMan inside of Katana. We then build some Physically Plausible Shaders which are assigned to the geometry of our environment. From there we add Physically Plausible Lights and look at using Aim to orientate them correctly. From there we talk about Co-Shaders vs Monolithic Shaders before building a Co-Shader setup in Katana..<br>**Class 5** In our fifth Katana class we look at extracting the specific local image parts from the main high dynamic range capture of the kitchen. These localized HDRI's are individually saved before being converted to RenderMan .tex and .env files using TXMAKE. From there we clean up the original image removing the lights we've extracted. Finally we move into Katana and build a test scene using Plausible shaders, Plausible Lights (with our new HDR's attached) and full Global Illumination..<br>**Class 6** In our sixth Katana class we start by looking at Scenegraph XML, a system for transferring data from Maya to Katana using an .xml and Python setup. Ben Greasley then takes up through the scripting side of things being we return to Katana to try the result..<br>**Class 7** In our seventh class we start in Maya and look at some issue regarding last weeks ScenegraphXML relating into UV's and Normals. From there we move into Katana and look at the creation of the final Shaders and Textures for our main character. We also look at CEL and how it can be used to help automate the task of converting PolyMeshs into SubdMeshs. Next we move into Photoshop and look at how we created some of the textures and then converted the OpenEXR output to RenderMan Texture files using 'txmake'. We then head back into Katana to create our master LookFile before returning to Maya briefly to create an animated version of our main character. Finally we bring that character back into Katana via our new ScenegraphXML Python script and reapply the LookFile..<br>**Class 8** In our eighth class we move away from our main project to look specifically at RenderMan for Katana.We look at Render Settings, Motion Blur, Depth of Field, and Render Passes. All this is done using our Pixar RenderMan teapot scene. We finish up the class in Nuke rebuilding the Beauty..<br>**Class 9** In our ninth class we start by loking at the animated character which has been created in Maya.

The most simple lens is no lens, we start with a pin hole camera of an entire room, (one room, one pin and a lot of ducktape) and also explore DSLR naked - lens free photography (one DLSR, a lens cap and a laser). From this most basic camera setup right through to Cooke Prime lenses this first class will explain the fundamentals. Lens design (mechanical and optical).<br>**Class 2** Price bracketing: Picking the right tool for the job - There is no point pretending we all have an infinite budget, but how do you weigh up when it is worth spending the extra money and when a simplier solution will work just as well? We explore lens mechanical design, heritage, and do a comparison between brands and models. This is an invaluable look at what you are actually paying for - from someone who breaks open lenses and knows exactly what is inside..<br>**Class 3** Focus, Gearing and Follow focus - If there is one central point to all lenses it is the ability to focus them and achieve sharp results. We explore focus systems from automatic to manual. Most professional lenses for film are fully manual, we also explore gearing gearing and lenses follow focus systems, including new controllers that try and bridge the gap between the advantages of manual and the speed of automatic..<br>**Class 4** Measuring and testing a lens - How do you know if a lens is any good? Is there anything you should do to test a lens? How lenses are checked at Duclos Lenses. Mike explains how aperture works and where the nodal point of a lens is..<br>**Class 5** Zooms: Lens stabilizing, why it can fail. This is everything you ever wanted to know about zoom lenses. How they work, what is happening to f stop and depth of field with doublers, lens breathing, optical tricks and we show when and where stabilizing zoom lenses fail. Most professionals shoot with Prime lenses why is that? Can a zoom compete and if not where would you notice the difference?.<br>**Class 6** Anamorphics both on a budget and when you have money to spare - One of the most exciting trends of the last 18 months has been the move to shooting anamorphicly. With Arri now supporting this across the new Alexa product line and the release of new Anamorphic lens, we explore how they work, how to shoot with them for creative effect and how to control the problems with Anamorphics that so many people actually seek such as flares, artifacts, glare and ghosting, shim and flare ups. We do this at the very high end with the newest lenses on the market and also on a budget. We'll show you how to make your own anamorphic lenses - at home!.<br>**Class 7** Odd lenses... The big, the odd and the wonderful - There are so many specialist lenses and unusual solutions. Sometimes these odd lenses can produce a unique look that will elevate a music video or solve a specialist problem - and sometimes they are just plain fun to shoot with! We explore mirror Lens - Shift and tilt, Fish eye... and even 0.7 fstop lenses..<br>**Class 8** Using unusual lenses to create unusual looks in camera..<br>**Class 9** IR and filters: Polluting the image - While lenses are self contained they often times have filters. While some of the importance of filters has changed to post production image processing, filters remain a valuable tool. We explore IR class Neutral density, ND, filters including how IR pollution works. Finally we explore filters in front and behind the lens..<br>**Class 10** A summary of considerations when choosing lenses for production and personal use and what is currently available on the market. |

Using simple tokens we will develop complex "production ready" pipelines to export plates, EDLs, XMLs, Wips and NUKE projects ready for compositing, grading and editing..<br>**Class 6** Re-Conform from new edits, even when you thought it was all locked and approved. Re-conforming unlocked EDL's. We finish up our conform by re-conforming plates of updated edits and EDLs. We will show how to update timelines and re-conform new plates for updated shots in a production, how to compare edits and conform and manage cut downs, versions and multiple length edits..<br>**Class 7** Reviewing, roundtrip to NUKE, WIPs and client sessions. It's no secret that the pace of commercial is extremely fast, so we focus in one of the best features of HIERO; the automatic versioning of timelines to created the fastest WIPs and review sessions in commercial VFX history. We will go over how to make timeline exports with slates for client friendly WIPs and talk about how to use HIERO's bin tags and version selections to control what to show in a commercial VFX client session..<br>**Class 8** Problems and more problems. We talk about problems in HIERO and conforming in general. We develop workarounds to awkward re-times, weird speed ramps, broken time-codes and the problem of multiple versions.

| [384](https://www.fxphd.com/details/384/) | [RMS201](https://www.fxphd.com/details/384/) | Physically Plausible Shading in RenderMan Studio | **Class 1** New Features & Physically Plausible Shading Concepts - We spend the first part of Class1 introducing some of the new features in RenderMan Studio, what really sets it apart from previous versions pre-physically based paradigm. Then we dive into the scientific concepts and explanations of Physically Plausible Shading. We want to make sure we understand the science and definitions behind these new shaders and lights, before using them. We explore the advantages over the "traditional" shading and lighting we're used to from older methodologies..<br>**Class 2** In class2 we start on Image Based Lighting in RMS. We start off looking at some professionally captured unclipped HDR's shot by my colleague, and examine 8 pre-rendered images I made from an animated tv-production that used these lightmaps in a physically-plausible shading system in RMS4. We then open a Maya scene, with our Vespa scooter model, and start from scratch to walk through how we use these HDR's in RMS4 within a physically-plausible framework. We look at the plausible shaders in Hypershade, and rendering in IT and RenderView. We go through the parameters of the EnvLight, including samples, scale intensity, importance sampling, radius, etc. We also experiment with other HDR maps, and raytraced re-rendering..<br>**Class 3** In class 3 we continue on with Image Based Lighting in RMS. In this class we explore the distribution modes: filtered importance, importance, uniform, and cosine. These are options on the RMSEnvLight and we want to gain and understanding of exactly how they work: we explore the methodology behind them, and do interactive renders in RMS with the different modes. One very common technique in production is further enhancing creative control of the IBL lighting by cutting out certain light sources from our HDR, and placing them onto area lights: This enables us to creatively move those high contrast light sources, be it an outdoor HDR or studio lighting, to where we want to position them, as well as tune the sampling for each source and change its intensity. We go through this process step by step in RMS, and see the pros and cons of this hybrid approach to IBL..<br>**Class 4** In class4 we move onto RMSGlass and transparent objects. Starting off with some concepts and fundamentals in shading glass we talk about reflection/refraction rays and index of refraction. We look at some production example tests and how to get rid of artifacts we might encounter in indirect specular and refraction when rendering with glass in RMS. We then move onto our scene with a nice wineglass example, go over the parameters in RMSGlass and do some renders. Going deeper into the glass shader itself, we look at the unique way of how Renderman Studio picks up the factory shaders from a specific directory, compiles them along with the RIB automatically into your project directory. We tune our RFM .ini file to keep our final shader source code, and overview the final glass shader source code for our project. Next we look at Arbitrary Output Variables in RMS (AOVs), how to set them up, and where they get their information from within the glass shaders. With our AOV's we render direct and indirect specular and refraction passes, and take it a step further by modifying the factory glass shader source code to add our own custom AOV, see how that shader gets compiled, and view our new AOV inside RMS/Maya: this is important for production as we need the knowledge of how to modify these factory shaders should a production call for it, especially custom AO's..<br>**Class 5** In Class5 we continue with our RMSGlass shading from the previous class, and cover the important shadowing modes (Opaque, Compute Opacity, View Dependent). When doing glass shading, the natural extension is to explore caustics and photon mapping, so we carry on with those topics in our scene. We go through the specific steps in RMS to setup our CausticLight and generate photons (either "transient" in memory, or ptc file), then render our scene with these new features, and compare renders with different settings in the CausticLight. We also explore the Internal Reflection Limit functionality, look at which AOV shows our Caustic effects, and experiment with the Glass Color..<br>**Class 6** In Class6 we dive into Arealights! Touching on them in previous classes, we go deeper on what makes area lights important in our Physically Plausible Paradigm, explain the squared exponential falloff, and why size is critical. We build up our scene from scratch where we test & compare different settings of our arealights, in particular the camera samples with materials of different roughness, examining the beauty, specular, and direct diffuse AOV's. Using raytraced shadows for our tests, we discuss the alternate "areashadow deepshadow" method that can have advantages in production scenes, especially ones with a lot of hair & fur. We use a fur system from one of the RFM tutorial files in our scene and demonstrate the setup of the areashadow deepshadow, render with it, and compare to our raytraced shadows..<br>**Class 7** In class7 we continue on our track of arealights, and cover production topics that we didn't get to in the previous class. We start off with one of the main tenants of arealights: soft shadows! We explore how the size of the arealight effects shadow softness, and the resulting sample count that may need adjusting. We try this on a few different models, including the famous walking teapot, as well as a new 356 Porsche model. We continue by adding in a GI Light and see how that interacts with our arealight setup, and some of the key principles there. Then we move onto "blockers", hook them up to our arealight, and do an interactive re-render session positioning the blocker exactly where we want it. With a fresh scene we move onto another production-savvy topic: diffuse bounce cards in conjuction with the RMSArealight, we set this up from scratch and bring in our GI Light and set proper Camera/Diffuse/Transmission visibility attributes. Finally, we end off with a time saving render feature frequently used in production: Aggressive shadows..<br>**Class 8** In Class8 we start a new topic: raytraced scatter! This is a great new feature in RMS, and there are huge advantages of a single-pass raytraced approach, as opposed to managing multi-pass point cloud rendering approaches. We start off with some definitions of important parameters and concepts like our Albedo & Diffuse Mean Free Path, then jump into a fresh scene in Maya with a new character model to setup our Scatter. Using the RMSGPSurface shader, we enable the scatter functionality by manipulating some parameters. We want to see our scatter pass on its own so we modify the RMSGPSurface shader to add our Subsurace AOV, and also add a brand new parameter & functionality to our shader to enhance our rendering: this requires explanation of the ".slim" file associated with the shader source code in RenderMan Studio, and what it takes to add a new parameter and re-compile. This is great under-the-hood knowledge to add to your toolkit to use on any modification you want to make, a great tool for customized production work!.<br>**Class 9** In Class9 we continue on Part 2 of our raytraced subsurface scatter: touching on last class's topic of Diffuse Visibility being necessary on the model for the raytraced scatter to engage, we explain how this setting can also be achieved through the Render Stats "Visible In.." settings, and how this is a redundancy to setting it via the Attributes>RenderMan menu - this is important to know since they do the same thing, and if you are coming from an RPS background or have used RenderMan with other 3d packages. We show the differences in the RIB file as we change those settings, so we know what's really going on under the hood - we'll need to know this in production if we are troubleshooting any scene. Carrying on with our scatter we want to explore the visual subtleties of our subsurface scatter parameters - we defined them and briefly went over them in the previous class, but how are the Tint & Albedo Tint's different, what are the subtle difference with the Diffuse Mean Free Path, and the DMFP Color? These are questions we answer as we look at side-by-side comparisons of these great controls on our subsurface scatter renders..<br>**Class 10** In Class10 we finish off the course with a new topic: Displacements in our physically plausible RMSGPSurface & RMSMatte shaders! We start off with showing some production examples of how powerful displacement shading is in RenderMan, then use our physically plausible shader RMSGPSurface to drive displacement mapping in our test scene, going over the purpose of the various displacement parameters. With our physically plausible shading, its paramount we correctly set our displacement attributes such as trace displacements, as well as displacement bounds, and explore the RIB file to see how these setting actually get implemented. We compare "bump" to "displace", and go over the very handy "txmake" utility to convert our displacement textures for RMSGPSurface, and setting up our paths in our shell terminal to be able to run "txmake" and "it" from the command line. With a new scene we then demonstrate the importance of specifically setting the Shading Rate on your objects that are being displaced, as this setting especially has a big effect on rendering quality when doing displacement. A really handy AOV to setup is visualizing our displacement map, so we go into the appropriate shader header file that does the texture call, and add our custom AOV, re-compile, and see it in action in our RMS render. Finally, we close off with a sneak peak of some great features coming soon to the next releases of RPS & RMS!. |

Look at where Houdini has been and where it is now with Houdini 12.5 Discuss an overview of the topics we'll be covering such as CloudFX, OceanFX, OpenVDB, FLIP Fluids, Bullet and Lighting and Rendering..<br>**Class 2** We'll discuss what OpenVDB is and how sparse volumes allow us to work much more efficiently and effectively in H12.5. We'll point out some of the new H12.5 tools that also make use of vdb under the hood. Finally, we'll work on a mini project where we use vdb tools to model a creative, organic looking landscape with an lsystem tree and particle driven, growing magical plants. We'll convert the entire setup into a single renderable polygon soup mesh..<br>**Class 3** We'll investigate noise and how to use it to deform geometry and volumes. We'll use VOP SOPs for manipulating standard geometry and Volume VOPs for volumes. The Volume Gradient from File and the Volume Sample from File, will help us to add noise to our volumes. Then we'll recreate the same type of effect with code using H12.5's new Point Wrangle and Volume Wrangle SOPs..<br>**Class 4** A very exciting new feature in Houdini 12.5 is the CloudFX tools, which is built upon OpenVDB. These are the Cloud Rig, Cloud, Cloud Noise and Cloud Light tools. We'll look at how we can create a single cloud and then more complex and exciting cloud systems with ease using a variety of methods. In one example, we will take a look at the Volume Stamp tool, which acts like copy stamping for volumetrics..<br>**Class 5** We will look at some specific FLIP Fluids enhancements and optimizations. The highly requested ability to have viscosity in Houdini 12. However, this did not support variable, changing, viscosity. In Houdini 12.5, you now have the power to animate density and viscosity in FLIP Fluids. FLIP fluids are even faster than before and more scalable. We will use these new abilities to work on a short miniproject of a melting object..<br>**Class 6** We will pick up where we left off in our melting object miniproject and begin refining and adding more details to the overall look. We will discuss techniques for artistically controlling the way in which the object melts and add in some detailed dripping sections. Then we will light, shade and render everything using PBR..<br>**Class 7** Discuss the new OceanFX Wave Tool, which allows you to deform geometry into an animated ocean surface. We'll compare this to previous methods for creating oceans in Houdini such as the HOT (Houdini Ocean Toolkit), then segue this into the new and exciting built-in OceanFX Wave tool. We'll then use it to create our own ocean surface by deforming geometry and then exploring ways to export out a displacement texture and displacement volume to disk and use these in displacement shaders to get very high resolution displacement at render time and independent of the resolution of the input geometry..<br>**Class 8** Look at driving ocean foam and spray effects with the ocean fx tools in H12.5. We'll also get an object to float on top of the surface of the ocean. Then we'll finish up the class with a quick look at how to create shaders using built in materials and a custom shader for our ocean and foam effect..<br>**Class 9** We'll discuss the OceanFX Wave Tank Tool, which allows you to create a FLIP fluid simulation from an animated ocean surface. It even comes with whitewater built in! We'll then take a look at objects can float or sink in regards to the simulated ocean..<br>**Class 10** Cover Masks and Pumps with Fluids in order to get a better understanding of how to control different areas of a fluid with velocity. This leads us to getting our ocean wave motion to effect our wave tank flip fluid motion over time. We'll use a variety of methods to do this. Finally, we will talk about how to control whitewater effects such as spray, foam and bubbles in your fluid simulations. |

| [393](https://www.fxphd.com/details/393/) | [NUK306](https://www.fxphd.com/details/393/) | Production Nuke Finishing | **Class 1** Powerful tools: Position maps. We jump right in with one of Alex's favorite tools, we circle back on some of these concepts but positional maps really show the power of Nuke as a compositor. Position maps, which I have found extremely powerful, can be relatively new to some compositors. We explain what they are, why they are so powerful, especially in for working in Stereo. We also share tricks for manipulating P maps, using them with projection and positionToPoint..<br>**Class 2** Nuke is a three dimensional compositor. To get the most out of the product you need to understand camera. Both how the real world cameras relate to Nuke's and also the flexibility (and limitations) of Nuke's own cameras. We cover Overscan, Rotational order, film backs and stereo camera model. In particular how camera and camera projections work closely together..<br>**Class 3** Metadata tricks. We have some fun working with material were we need to create cameras from EXIF data. In a perfect world all on set data would be provided but often times we need to build back out what happened and complete the metadata jigsaw. This also cover some basic Python tricks and techniques..<br>**Class 4** Working with takes and time and how its different in Nuke. We work with time as a variable: looking at Offsets, Appends and Retiming such as matching to a ref from editorial. It is rare that Nuke artists are not called upon to address timing issues of shots in inside shots, combining multiple takes. This can get confusion and yet is extremely common now from some directors and in some productions..<br>**Class 5** Compositing CG into live action requires more than just matching the black levels and removing edges, we discuss setting up the correct AOVs, mutlipass rendering, correct handling of Matte, patching frames and dealing with issues such as noise, lens distortion and the power of projections over CGI..<br>**Class 6** Depth of Field. One of the great ways to add production value and also sell a shot as real is getting the Depth of Field accurate and matching correctly. From exteriors outside car windows to landscapes beyond windows and just standard compositing work, nothing can give a way a shot as a comp more reliably than an impossible depth of field that mis-matches. I share some really great techniques to getting the DOF right, it seems simple but it is so often finaled incorrectly. You may not know why the shot looks fake, but it will if the DOF is wrong..<br>**Class 7** Colourspace. You cannot professionally finish a shot if you cannot control the color. Color management is vital to have a consistent pipeline, to not lose hours in a major production. We cover 1D luts 3D luts, OCIO, the increasingly important ACES workflow in Nuke and visualising colorspace transformations using positionToPoint..<br>**Class 8** Selling a CG shot. Placing CG in context is often about contact lighting and comping in correct reflections. We look at what you can do to sell a shot and place the CG correctly. Sometimes this is not about technical accuracy, even a perfect HDR CG element may seem to float, we explore grounding your work and polishing a comp. This now extends to Deep color and deep compositing, and placing elements correctly in atmospherics..<br>**Class 9** Putting shots up in dailies and how to sell your shots. Further review of submitted comps..<br>**Class 10** Using particle systems in Nuke to simulate low poly models for filling out background scene elements. |

We get to know the euclidean space and understand vectors from a geometric point of view. Then we're ready to have a look at the most basic geometric primitive, the point. Once we are familiar with these points and arrows we learn about operations between them like adding and subtracting two vectors and multiplying them by a single number..<br>**Class 2** Now we elaborate on vectors. We learn about linear combinations of vectors and how to represent a line inside a computer system in may different ways. We review the line equation in standard and slope-intercept form. Then we have a look at lines as parametric equations and finally as a linear combination of vectors. To illustrate the new concepts we build a linear distribution expression with Xpresso..<br>**Class 3** We continue with the linear interpolation expression. We enhance the expression by adding a MoGraph style effector based on distance. Therefore we discuss distance and the length of vectors. The pythagorean theorem is reviewed and visually proven. Then we start with our discussion about circles. A polar coordinate system is introduced. Finally we have a look at radians vs. degrees to measure angles as a preparation for trigonometry..<br>**Class 4** We discuss the trig functions sine and cosine as a way to convert between a polar and a Cartesian representation of the circle.

Finally we focus on Bezier curves. We explore the De Casteljau algorithm to calculate spline points and build a Bezier curve from scratch inside of C4D..<br>**Class 5** We enlarge upon Bezier curves. From the geometric interpretation we derive the explicit formula for Bezier curves and find the Bernstein polynomials. After having a deep look at t and the parameter space we have a look at the "Align To Spline" Tag, Sweep Nurbs and MoSpline inside of C4D to see what they've in common. We discuss the different methods for "intermediate points" on splines in C4D..<br>**Class 6** A baroque ornament is built and made grow. First we discuss curve continuity, tangents and curvature of splines and what makes a spline appear smooth. Then we draw and import ornament splines and use them to model a baroque ornament inside of C4D. Different possibilities for growth are discussed and after choosing a route the ornament is prepared for applying growth expressions..<br>**Class 7** The baroque ornament asset is finished. We build an Xpresso expression to grow an individual vein and discuss the idea of creating a self contained component out of this growing vein. Then these components are used to build the entire hierarchical asset. We have a look at relative references and user data to create individual veins that attach to each other automatically..<br>**Class 8** This time we have a look at ecosystems. In detail we focus on the distribution of plants on the plane. To mimic this behavior inside the computer we create a dart throwing algorithm with Thinking Particles in C4D. We write a python node to be able to perform two iterations over the particle array per frame. TP execution order and groups are explained..<br>**Class 9** Finishing up with ecosystems..<br>**Class 10** We look at phyllotaxis, the science of the distribution of individual parts on plants. We analyze how different species grow and discuss the scheme that's responsible for the look of plants like pines or palm trees. Then we develop an Xpresso expression to mimic this behavior inside of C4D. Finally Manuel shows you a finished phyllotaxis Generator to generate different types of plants. These can then be used to populate the ecosystem. |

One of the things that you get asked to do as a motion graphics artist is end tags. There will always be another end tag to complete and there is rarely enough time to do something cool. We discuss how Ryan used Trapcode Particular to generate a transition that is both fast to create and flexible for multiple uses. And then Ryan shows you how to link it to data from Cinema 4D so you can integrate it with your CG renders. Examples will include a National Geographic spot as well as a teaser for Elder Scrolls Online..<br>**Class 2** Lightning in a Bottle.

Once we've got our basic structure for the Stage Five ID project down in Cinema 4D, it's now time to make it sing. We'll look at using our old friend Trapcode Particular along with Trapcode Form to enhance the environment we built in the previous class..<br>**Class 5** Person of Interest Project Breakdown, Part 01. For a project that was initially only supposed to be type over image, Person of Interest sure did get pretty complicated. This week will be about creating systems that can do lots of work for you, freeing you up to spend more time designing the bigger challenges. We will go through how to create a self-animating UI grid, as well as some tracking techniques..<br>**Class 6** Person of Interest Project Breakdown, Part 02. We never were going to move the camera in Person Of Interest, nor were we going to have many 3D elements. If you've seen the opening, you'll note that we did plenty of the opposite. See how we were able to leverage client assets along with Trapcode Form and some simple camera moves to add enough production value to a project to actually hear the client say the word "bitching" for the first time ever..<br>**Class 7** Failure. The Big F. We'll take a look at a pitch project and look at where we went wrong and the lessons learned along the way..<br>**Class 8** Prof Frederick Ross: Amazon Whispersync: In the superhero world of Steelheart we go from reading the ebook to listening to the audiobook on a mobile device seamlessly.

This class focuses on cutting edge light weight gyro stabilizers..<br>**Class 6** Steadicam. Designing shots that work for Steadicam. The Steadicam is a great tool but it is better with certain approaches and shots should be designed that take advantage of the systems grace while avoiding using it for shots better done more traditionally. We will design a series of shots and explain the principles of the rigs, especially given that new smaller cameras are allowing so many more operators to own and fly their own rigs. Plus we break down the practical implementation of tracking markers for shooting greenscreen material..<br>**Class 7** Car Rigs. High quality DSLRs and much smaller camera rigs are allowing for cheap and very creative car mount kits. We discuss shooting car dialogue - how to get coverage and how to avoid studio green screen solutions by filming with real cars using handheld, MOVI and car mount kits. What are some great camera angles, what is possible and how safe are the rigs?.<br>**Class 8** Shooting with shoulder rigs - these can allow you to achieve very natural camera motion. We also use the shoulder rigs to film plates for what will eventually be a VFX transition shot between the two plates..<br>**Class 9** Helicopters. Big and small Helicopters are some of the most interesting mounts and produce some of the most wonderful establishing or environment shots. We examine rigs, monitoring and how much this has advanced in recent years..<br>**Class 10** Fluid heads vs geared heads. |

We export elements to Flame where we comp the shot and we finish by re-distorting elements using a UV map in Flame..<br>**Class 3** Everyday Expressions - Expressions are incredibly useful and many Flame Artists often use them to create setups that are as flexible as possible. We start with very simple expressions that artists use every day and we see how easy it is to create them. We get more complicated as we look at using expressions to invert and offset tracking data. Then we then look at how you can use a diffuse map to recreate the famous Extended Bicubic trick and why you do not need to use that trick in Flame 2014. Lastly, we take a look at a slightly more advanced animation rig utilizing the new Variables Matchbox Shader..<br>**Class 4** The Distort Node - We learn why the Distort Node is probably John's favorite node in Flame. We examine four shots and how the Distort Node can be used for a variety of common tasks. We look at a simple morph using two frames, using a single frame of video to track organic shapes, automatically animate objects, perform spline-based warping and fixing tracking issues between two plates. Finally, we also examine a color matching technique which can be used in a number of situations, especially when tracking/distorting still frames..<br>**Class 5** Crayola - We cover a basic use of Flame Particles. Next we compare the Flame workflow to the AE-Particular workflow for the same shots..<br>**Class 6** We'll explore some of the features new to the 2014 versions of Flame and Smoke..<br>**Class 7** SAP - We'll take a look at building a nested zoom in Flame and how an After Effects tutorial inspired John's use of expressions. We'll also examine Atomize and some other design techniques used to create a "digital city"..<br>**Class 8** Breathing Life Into a Still - We start with PFMatchIt to quickly get a virtual camera. We'll take that camera into Maya where we'll dig a little deeper into modeling for projections. Having completed the modeling, we'll go into Flame, prep the carious layers to use as projections, and build a camera move. We'll also review various techniques to create more animation in your scene. Lastly, we'll export the camera and prep it for use in After Effects where we'll use Particular to create some atmospheric effects..<br>**Class 9** Seamless Transition Part 1 of 2 - We'll start looking at 3d stabilizing which is the basis of our seamless transition. Then we'll look at tracking two shots, blending the cameras in Maya, building geometry for projections, and prepping everything for Flame..<br>**Class 10** Seamless Transition Part 2 of 2 - We'll put the finishing touches on our seamless transition. |
| [408](https://www.fxphd.com/details/408/) | [MDO201](https://www.fxphd.com/details/408/) | MODO 701 Particles, Dynamics & Effects | **Class 1** This course will begin with an overview of the replicator system. Many of the core components of the particle system stem from Replicators, so we'll explore the simple, yet powerful, set-up procedures for adding Replicators to our scene. In addition, we'll also take a look at the animation layout and briefly discuss the process of animating in Modo..<br>**Class 2** In order for us to quickly populate our scene with particles, we need to understand the basic simulation system in Modo. We'll explore the the different simulation types, their features and the best production pipeline for adding simulations in to our scene. Through this process of learning how to generate simulations in Modo, you'll learn how to simulate rigid body dynamics in Modo..<br>**Class 3** Now that we have a basic understanding of how the Modo simulation engine operates, let's begin to explore the different emitters types in Modo. The array of emitters types will allow us to create a huge spectrum of effects, so lets explore these unique items in Modo. Emitters, Radial, Curve, Surface, Source..<br>**Class 4** Collector Emitters are simulations that are based on the result of another simulation. Through the complex network of schematic nodes, we'll create compound particle effects in Modo. Let's check it out!.<br>**Class 5** At times, we want the parameters of our particles to be effected by events within our 3D scene. We'll look at that role of Terminators and discover how we can filter events within our scene to kill our particles or spawn new particles. Paired with Falloffs, Terminators are an exciting addition to the particle engine in Modo and ultimately allow us to create dynamic particle effects..<br>**Class 6** We take a look at how to apply forces within our 3D scene. The Modo particle system allows us to create a series of intricate forces that will influence our particle simulations in some really awesome ways. Let's check it out! Any force item can be linked to a particle simulation as a filter. Particles will accelerate based on the strength of the force at their location and their mass. These are the same forces used for rigid body dynamics..<br>**Class 7** At the core of the Modo particle system resides a powerful engine that allows us to intelligently parse particle simulations on rules, or expressions, within the scene. Adding Particle Modifiers to the schematic layout of our scene can instantly change the complexity, accuracy and creative result of our particle system..<br>**Class 8** The Particle Operator is a general filter modifier type item that can be used to process and modify all particles in a simulation based on user selected Features. Let's take a look at how we can set-up our scene to include this exciting new addition to the Modo particle system..<br>**Class 9** We are going to talk about Flock and Dynamic Colliders. Flocking is a particle operator that creates forces between particles that produce distinct particles groups or clumps. The Dynamic Collider has no user adjustable attributes in the Properties panel, it is merely meant as a bridge to share data between a particle simulation and a soft or hard-body dynamics simulation when calculating collisions between them. This allows users to control which simulations are necessary to share data, which can save valuable calculation time for complex simulations of all types. Let's take a look!.<br>**Class 10** We wrap up our introduction to the particle system in Modo by addressing a few strategies on rendering particle simulations in Modo. Rendering passes is easy to setup in Modo, so lets take a moment to explore this feature. |

| [416](https://www.fxphd.com/details/416/) | [ARN201](https://www.fxphd.com/details/416/) | Real World Lighting and Rendering with Arnold | **Class 1** The World of Arnold. We briefly cover the history of Arnold, its implementation of Physically Plausible Rendering and how it handles a Linear Colour Workflow. From there we move into lighting, shading and rendering a basic scene enabling everyone to gain a basic understanding of the Arnold workflow and setup..<br>**Class 2** Render Settings. From here we use some predesigned scenes to learn about Arnold’s render settings and how they can be optimized to produce the most realistic results fast and efficiently. We look at Samples, Ray Depth, Motion Blur, System Settings, and Overrides. This will form the basis for all our future lessons and lay the groundwork for producing realistic renders in Arnold..<br>**Class 3** Lighting. We move our attention to lighting. We look first at the extra photographic attributes Arnold brings to pre-existing Maya lights including Degrees Kelvin and Exposure. From there we turn our attention to the extra lights which ship with Arnold, these include Area, Mesh, and IBL (Image Based Lighting). Finally we look at various filters such as Blockers, Gobos and Barndoors..<br>**Class 4** Camera and Per-Object Settings. We start by looking at cameras and the Arnold settings associated with them such as Type, Exposure, Rolling Shutter and Depth of Field. We then transition to looking at Per-Object Settings which enable us to do things such as adjust Shadows, Visibility and Subdivision Settings, and render Curves..<br>**Class 5** Shaders (Part 1). We start a two part study of Arnold shaders. We start with the most common shader, the Standard Shader. From there we look at the Sub-Surface Scatter and Shadow Catcher shaders..<br>**Class 6** Shaders (Part 2) and Textures. In our second lesson on shaders, we examine some of the more utilitarian options including Matte, Motion Vector, Ray Switch, Wireframe, and Utility. From there we look at the various Arnold Textures, Bump and Displacement settings, UserData attributes and the use of MipMaps..<br>**Class 7** AOVs (Arbitrary Output Variables). We take our existing projects and render them out using Arnold's AOVs. These include various Shader passes: Diffuse (direct/indirect), Specular (direct/indirect), Reflection, Refraction, Emission and various Subsurface Scatter passes. We also look at some of the utility passes including: Normal, Point, Z Depth, Motion Vector, Deep and ID.

Finally we use a number of the utility passes to add realism to our composite..<br>**Class 8** Particles. We look at how Arnold works with Particles. We start by examining the limitations of rendering Particles in Arnold, then move on to looking at Particle Sub-Surface Scattering, Sampler Info, Caching, Motion Blur and finally Instancing..<br>**Class 9** Hair and Fur. We move into looking at Hair and Fur, and more importantly how Arnold Renders them. We cover a host of areas including Modes, MPW (Min Pixel Width), Transparency Depth, and general Optimization and Caching techniques..<br>**Class 10** Miscellaneous Topics. We look at a mishmash of topics which are important but did not fit in earlier. We look at Stand-ins, Environmental Fog, Atmospheric Volume Scattering, Make .tx, Batch Rendering, .ass files, kick, and the importance of .log files. |

| [418](https://www.fxphd.com/details/418/) | [MAR201](https://www.fxphd.com/details/418/) | Intermediate MARI Techniques | **Class 1** Prep and asset creation. Tiled UV Workflow. We spend this class to talk about the characteristics of the model we are working with, the screen space that it intends to take up and the mood we wish to convey as well as the type of concept art we wish to find that will help speak for our intentions. This all directly correlates to the types of textures that we are going to paint down the line. It is an extremely important step as it drives what we do for the remainder of the course. We also talk about why Mari thrives with tiled UV assets..<br>**Class 2** General base layer overview. We start things off by getting a basic base layer on the model. This gives us a chance to talk about Mari's procedural painting tools as well as why color keys are important for parts of the visual effects pipeline, like animation. We also talk about image import, shader creation in Mari and VRay and map export..<br>**Class 3** Jump suit. This is where we start painting our first maps using the paint-through tool and we start talking about how to use filters as well as the new paint and adjustment layers found in Mari 2.0 to tweak our projections after we baked our textures down to maintain a nondestructive workflow. We explain the difference between copying and sharing layers and how masks can be used to affect other channels in our shaders..<br>**Class 4** Gloves, shoes and accessories. Here we move onto other parts of the asset where we can explore different types of materials and textures. This will also give us a chance to talk about how to copy baked maps from one UV tile to another, a very efficient workflow in getting detail to the rest of your model in an effortless way..<br>**Class 5** Helmet and head. Time to talk skin! Here we work with some face and head projections, create subsurface maps, eye maps and show an alternative way to do eyelashes. We also paint up the helmet with decals and incandescent maps if you want to add lights inside the helmet..<br>**Class 6** Finalize pilot. We wrap up our lesson on skin and subsurface and review the helmet while making sure our entire asset is balanced and to our liking. This is super important before we move on to next week where we start adding our base wear and tear and add little things like decals, etc..<br>**Class 7** LightBrush. We take a look at the ins and outs of LightBrush which will effectively paint lighting information out of our source photography. It does this by taking in a few inputs from the user and it then separates illumination from reflectance, giving us a flat image that we can directly use in Mari. This shaves hours off the cleanup process and is just amazingly fun to use!.<br>**Class 8** LightBrush + Jet Wing Continued. We are pushing the use of LightBrush a little further with a real-time demo of how to use the textures we shot in LightBrush and unify (color correct) them for use in Mari. A little more time is spent on blending these maps together on the geometry and we get a preview of how this will work once we get to our grunge lesson next week..<br>**Class 9** Grunge. This week we discuss the power of shared layers, particularly when used as masks between channels. We spend a bit of time talking about how to consolidate and cache your completed base layers to speed up Mari as well. This allows us to delve into creating detailed grunge maps for when we want to both eat away at surfaces as well as paint blood and dirt across multiple objects in our scene..<br>**Class 10** Final. We wrap things up by making sure you have got a firm understanding on what your grunge maps are doing for you. To do that, we spend a bit more time in Mari to show what you can do with them in the texture painting phase. Then we jump to VRay to create a rendering pass for the grunge maps. Finally, we take things to Nuke where we do a quick composite of all the lighting passes and show you how you can even further change the look of your grunge maps (and character), even in the final stage of the visual effects process. |

So we look at cutting a simple car up into pieces using the voronoi SOP then convert into Packed Primitives..<br>**Class 2** We look at extending our car simulation with constraints, the new way of creating constraints in Houdini 13. So we will use both glue and normal constraints. All setup is done in SOPs level and then constraints will be updated procedural inside DOPs.<br>**Class 3** We extend our car simulation with some more constraint types and problems that may occur when we increase speed of the car..<br>**Class 4** So to this point we just done a basic simulation inside DOP:s, we are going to extend it with the use of a SOP solver insideDOPs..<br>**Class 5** We start on a new project, collaborating with Russell Dodgson's NUK301 course. The project involves a proper model and animation of a airplane that is crashes on a airstrip in the jungle. Rigging is this weeks topic: how do we pipeline the plane model and set up all the constraints? The plane comes from Maya, as an Alembic Cache from disk, showing how real production is done and how we accommodate changes in the model while we are doing a rig for RBD objects in DOPs.<br>**Class 6** The animation has been updated, so has the model has changed. We are going to change the rig to be more production ready, so when animation or the model change, we just plug the new airplane into our scene.<br>**Class 7** The sim is looking more or less in the ballpark of what our final one will look like, just need to add some detail in the simulation So we go back to the SOP solver in DOPs and look at how to add some deformations to the plane when it hits the ground..<br>**Class 8** We lock the RBD simulation and add fire/explosion elements. We look at the basic tools inside DOPs to create the explosion simulation..<br>**Class 9** We take the explosion from last week and add it to our rig in SOPs, so if animation changes, we can simply update the rig and simulation will update automatically..<br>**Class 10** Finalise the shot with some rendering, as rendering in Mantra would require a whole term of its own, I will have pre made a Render Scene to create the final elements for comp. So it will be a basic overview of rendering hard surfaces and fluids. |
| [420](https://www.fxphd.com/details/420/) | [NUK224](https://www.fxphd.com/details/420/) | Zombie Panic | **Class 1** Planning and prep for the shoot. Reviewing the types of shots we want to get and what the best way to pull off our shots will be. We will go though a VFX supervisors kit, show what each piece of gear is used for and shoot some lens distortion grids. We will then take our grids into NUKE 8 and cover the new tracker upgrades focusing on lens distortion..<br>**Class 2** We now survey the location photographically with IBLs to use in a later class. We talk about shooting Image Based Lighting for some of our CGI based effects, and shoot a couple of HDRI panoramas using a 360 degree Nodal Ninja head, how to convert it too a mirror ball. We then stitch the images together and use NUKE to patch problem areas..<br>**Class 3** Decapitation part1. In the first part of this shot, we use NUKE's new camera tracker and 2D tracker to build out a clean plate. We reconstruct or actors face to fill in the gaps and get our plate ready for CG..<br>**Class 4** Decapitation part2. We use photogrammetry to capture the actor on-set and use this data to construct the neck. This class focus on setting up the AOVs and compositing the severed neck into the shot..<br>**Class 5** Decapitation part3. Finally we add blood spatters both practical and Real Flow, colour correction with NUKE 8 new colour controls, film grain, and final touches that bring the shot to completion..<br>**Class 6** Torso Crawler part1. We start our new shot, the zombie torso. In this shot we are going to start out by 3D tracking the plate and getting a good solve. Not only do we cover getting the camera tracked, but in this shot we also need to track the lower waist were we will be replacing later with CG..<br>**Class 7** Torso Crawler part2. Now that the shot is tracked, we build our clean plates. We use reconstructions, paint, and projections to fill in all the areas of the actress that need to be transparent..<br>**Class 8** Torso Crawler part3. Now we paint our asset, jump into to Maya, set up animation, and use our Image Based Lighting that we took on set. Set up the proper AOV's and set up some realistic sub surface scattering for that fleshy look..<br>**Class 9** Torso Crawler part4. Now we take our renders and set up a multi-pass composite for the CGI element. We look at a bunch of methods to pull it off, including ways to create dynamic lighting and save the render. Sometimes, when a deadline is looming you don't have the time to re-render CG..<br>**Class 10** Torso Crawler part5. Finally we add all the final touches that bring the shot to completion. Colour grading, film grain management, lens effects, and camera shake. |

Along the way we'll talk about Maya's inbuilt Curve tools and various problems that can come up when importing Curves into Maya..<br>**Class 8** In our eighth class we conclude our study of Curves and Surface tools by way of another project which utilises functions such as Revolve, Loft, Extrude and Planar. We'll also look at some of the more complicated Surface tools including Birail (1, 2, and 3+), Boundary, Square and (Animated) Sweep..<br>**Class 9** In our ninth class we start a new project looking at the various Deformers found inside of Maya. Although many of these can be used for animation they also make fantastic modelling tools. This week we'll look at Lattice (FFD), Wrap, ShrinkWrap, Cluster and Soft Modification..<br>**Class 10** In our tenth and final class of the term we'll continue with our Deformer project looking at more tools including Non-Linear Deformers (Bend, Flare, Sine, Squash (and Stretch), Twist, Wave), Sculpt Deformer, Texture Deformer, Wire and Wrinkle. |

| [449](https://www.fxphd.com/details/449/) | [NUK309](https://www.fxphd.com/details/449/) | Advanced NUKE & Digital Environments | **Class 1** We will take a close look at each of our shots to identify potential difficulties and discuss potential solutions. We will then take a look at a typical film workflow between editorial, the lab and VFX, and what it means in terms of color I/O. We will look at the advantages (and disadvantages) of the match grade tool as well as output formats and color space issues..<br>**Class 2** We will start working on our "warm up" shot by matching in and grading a background, and then dive into extraction techniques, taking an in-depth look at the IBK, hard and soft matting, background luminosity issues and more..<br>**Class 3** We will continue working on the shot, identifying and solving problematic areas like hair and defocused edges. We will also take a look at Hiero and discuss some of the features that make it a great review tool for compositing..<br>**Class 4** Time to start working on our "hero" shot. After a quick and dirty extraction, we'll set up the scene and the camera, create some proxy geo in Nuke and start building up the background using a panoramic stitch..<br>**Class 5** In order to progress with the shot we need to do some major cleanup work. We'll start by covering some useful techniques for removing intersecting markers and rigs, dealing with uneven green screens and rotoscoping. When the layers are precomped and ready, it's time to move to Maya.<br>**Class 6** We'll model the balcony in Maya and use Nuke to create textures. We'll then set up shaders and lighting with Arnold, discussing on the way some key settings and features of this great renderer. We'll set up render layers and AOV's and look at ways to use passes in Nuke to improve the integration..<br>**Class 7** To populate our balcony with some potted plants, we'll use SpeedTree to create some custom plant assets and add some subtle wind animation. Back in Maya, we'll prep the plants for Arnold by assigning and tweaking shaders..<br>**Class 8** Putting it all together. All elements, renders and passes are now combined in Nuke for final comp. Edges are tweaked, motion blur restored, subtle flaring added, rack focus emulated - the final 10% are the hardest - and the most crucial..<br>**Class 9** A new shot, a new challenge. Here we'll be dealing with integrating matte painting elements into a backlit environment. We'll look at different ways to make elements sit in the plate, concentrating on subtle color work, 2D lighting, hazing and lens effects restoration..<br>**Class 10** To add some movement and depth to the matte painting, we'll go back to 3D Maya and generate some fire and smoke sims using Maya fluids. Then it's back to Nuke for integrating the elements, more 2D lighting and final comp. |
| [450](https://www.fxphd.com/details/450/) | [PHG101](https://www.fxphd.com/details/450/) | Introduction to Photogrammetry | **Class 1** Introduces the course discussing what is to be developed throughout the classes. A run through of the six main course projects and what they entail. Including a demo style run through of project one Busbys Bore the content from class two. Ending with a look into camera specifications and a few issues around shooting for Photoscan. Purpose - show course content and develop an introductory appreciation of the process..<br>**Class 2** Taking the files demonstrated in class one Busbys Bore many steps deeper. Understanding photographs as data set, shooting patterns, resolution, image formats and qualifying images for use in Photoscan and the effects on processing speed. Working through image importation and processing, the chain of steps to model, texture creation and on to export to Zbrush and automated retopology. The result reimported into Photoscan for texture re-projection and export to FBX for use in Maya..<br>**Class 3** Using the Federation Dome project we again look at shooting patterns and work through at a deeper level from images to textured model and export via FBX to Maya. This time introducing camera projection using Matte Painters Toolkit. Along the way image alignment control and refinement pivotal to modelling success in Photoscan is covered in depth..<br>**Class 4** This time the Centennial Fountain project is used to continue looking into shooting patterns, site issues and work through at a deeper level from images to textured model and export via FBX to Maya. Introducing Lightbrush a method for reflectance texture creation for physically based rendering..<br>**Class 5** Mother's Day Footy statue. Each project has its own set of requirements and so again shooting patterns are discussed. Working through the Photoscan model creation this time looking into ways of fixing the meshing problems. Preparation for Mari its UDIMS and projectors. Working through direct export from Photoscan to Mari and from Maya to Mari..<br>**Class 6** Chopper Aerial Photography - we will be working with some aerial photography shot with a DSLR rigged to a quad copter. Once the frames have been extracted from the footage they are taken through the usual steps in Photoscan. The dense point cloud and model are exported from Photoscan and used in The Pixel Farm's PfTrack software. The footage is tracked then aligned with the point cloud the sum of that alignment is then used to align both the imported mesh and the extra mesh created in PfTrack. The aligned camera and mesh are then exported out to Maya and the scene recreated..<br>**Class 7** We tackle a fairly common problem with camera alignment using SynthEyes. From time to time a camera position or focal length change can throw the alignment of one camera out which can in turn affect the alignment of the following cameras. Using SynthEyes to manually pre-align the cameras fixes this problem..<br>**Class 8** We start out with reference to a forum question regarding how to colour balance images in preparation for use in Photoscan. Followed by an introductory look at PhotoScan's chunks in preparation for the Centennial Drive project..<br>**Class 9** We begin with the final visit to Zbrush to use Dynamesh to fill meshing holes followed by a reference to a forum question regarding shooting and processing interior spaces in Photoscan. Then onto the preparation set ups for the Centennial Drive project..<br>**Class 10** The Centennial Drive project is finished off with a further look into how chunking can assist with managing large data sets. Then the course is finished off with a look into shooting for a working with a small object data set based around a sand shoe. |
| [451](https://www.fxphd.com/details/451/) | [RND102](https://www.fxphd.com/details/451/) | Introduction to Path Tracing and RIS in RenderMan | **Class 1** What's new and goals for the course. Outline of new features, definitions, and some of the things we'll be doing with them. Answering questions to "What is RIS & Path Tracing?"..<br>**Class 2** New Disney "principled" BRDF via "PxrDisney" shader: the paper it was based off, explanations, and render examples..<br>**Class 3** We start off with illustrating the concept of bi-directional path-tracing, in the context of distributed ray-tracing and uni-directional path tracing. We look at diagrams and corresponding renders of how these different raytrace modes traverse and sample our scene with camera, light, and shadow rays. We then jump into a RenderMan Studio session with a new asset, the Stirling model provided by Pixar's RenderMan team, and start off by rendering in the REYES mode - we do this deliberately to segue into rendering in RIS with the same scene, and show how we have to re-assign all the new RIS/BRDF materials. This leads to focusing on the "Emissive" property of the PxrDisneyBRDF material, inspecting and experimenting with different sampling settings for ideal renders. We also render our "SmartCar" asset with the same material, adding metallic and anisotropic features of the PxrDisneyBRDF..<br>**Class 4** We start off by continuing with our "emissive" geo/light source from the previous lesson, and animate the sphere geo to see its effect on the ground and our car model. Doing this we notice we're not getting indirect contribution from our emissive geo in the reflection sphere, so we cover how to set that with an attribute, both global and on a per-object basis, and how it looks like in our RenderMan RIB. Then we jump into exploring Path Tracing (uni-dir) vs VCM (bi-directional) in our scene with a high-contrast dome light, and find that using a lower contrast dome light source really makes a difference in reducing artifacts in our VCM. We then take our Path vs VCM into a "Cornell Box" scene, and see the nice subtle bounce we get from the VCM with an arealight, as well as nice handling of caustics and refractions through glass..<br>**Class 5** We look at some important quality settings with both the Path Tracer and bi-directional VCM: Pixel Variance and Merge Radius Scale. We touch on comparisons of Pixel Variance to traditional RenderMan's PixelSamples setting when shading depth-of-field. To really see the features of the bi-directional VCM we explore a new interior scene setup with sharp caustics on glass and metals, and show how Merge Radius Scale affects the quality of our caustics and render time. Summarizing we see how the VCM works better on interior scenes with multiple dimly lit light sources, lots of bounce, and sharp caustics..<br>**Class 6** We want to explore scenarios where the uni-directional Path Tracer simply doesn't find the path to the light, and where we need to use the bi-directional VCM. One great example for this kind of scenario is a "recessed lighting" example, where there is no direct visible path to the light source, it needs to bounce off multiple objects to connect with objects in the scene visible to the camera rays. We take a look at this scenario through some diagrams explaining the light paths, and the "vertex connection" part of the VCM. An even better example is putting a light source enclosed in a "frosted glass" housing, showing the VCM will find the light path but the uni-directional path tracer will not. Finally, we touch on the difference between an geometry sphere with "emissive" shader parameter, and a spherical area light..<br>**Class 7** We start with a brand new scene: an interior "kitchen" with glass statue, to focus on the PxrGlass BxDF for this lesson. We go through each parameter of this material shader and focus on IOR, absorptionGain, and absorptionColor inside our new scene, noting the raytraced refraction and caustics with our PathTracer Integrator. We also look at the pros & cons of "internal RMS rendering" vs "external RPS rendering" while debugging our absorptionGain settings..<br>**Class 8** We continue with glass shading with our PxrGlass BxDF, and dive into a more advanced topic of "Nested Dielectrics"! To work through this topic we need to use a scene from the RenderMan documentation page in RIS/Shading/Materials/Examples and step out side of RMS to render manually from the RIB file while examinining and tweaking the "intersectpriority" and "indexofrefraction" attributes in the RIB file. With these settings we do a few iterations of the glass/water/airbubble geometry in the scene to see the complex nesting of different dielectric materials. We also spend some time in this lesson on "setup scripts" to give you the tools to customize your work environment when running RMS & RPS..<br>**Class 9** "Nested Dielectrics Part 2" is the main focus of this lesson, and we continue off the work we did in the previous lesson and answer some questions that came up, such as "How do we implement the RIB example from the docs in our own Maya/RMS scenes?" and "What if the attribute setting of indexofrefraction is different than the BxDF/shader IOR with respect to the intersectpriority?". We also break down exactly how we should set our "Max Path Length" on the Path Tracer Integrator, in conjunction with Max Spec/Diffuse Depth, when computing nested dielectrics..<br>**Class 10** Subsurface Scattering with PxrSkin. In this lesson we start on a new topic, diving into the PxrSkin BxDF material on our new statue model. PxrSkin has a new approach to dialing the levels of subsurface scatter, by having a default Near/Mid/Far setting for Color/Weight/Length parameters, and letting the user dial these 3 layers individually for more artistic control. We compare this approach with the "classic" DMFP table for scattering materials such as skin/ketchup/marble/milk, while defining and exploring the colors, weights, and DMFP lengths for each layer. Looking at our turntable renders we can see the subtle scatter through our model resulting from the different approaches. |
| [452](https://www.fxphd.com/details/452/) | [PRM204](https://www.fxphd.com/details/452/) | Premiere Pro - Working All Areas of a Project | **Class 1** Why Adobe Premiere Pro? - With all the other editorial tools out in the market why would an editor choose Adobe Premiere Pro CC over any of the others? What are its strengths and what are its weaknesses? What advancements has Adobe made since moving from CS6 to CC? What areas of the NLE still need attention? No holds barred as we prepare for the entire semester..<br>**Class 2** Before editing can begin media must be ingested into Adobe Premiere Pro CC and footage must be organized and logged. There are many different types of footage in our world of file based cameras (and Adobe Premiere Pro CC supports most all of them) and several ways to get them into the NLE. Once media is in we'll look at how to sort footage into bins and how to use subclips or markers for logging. We'll also take a look at Selects Sequences and how they can help organize footage as well..<br>**Class 3** We begin doing some actual editing but not before taking some time to go through more of the numerous settings and preferences that Premiere Pro has to offer. While we won't begin doing a lot of creative editing at this point we will look at various features within Premiere Pro that makes creating sequences and selects reels easier. These are all important things to learn that can be applied throughout editorial in Adobe Premiere..<br>**Class 4** We continue to look at basic editing in Adobe Premiere Pro CC. While we'll still look at number of preferences, menus and keyboard shortcuts we'll also dig deeper into the timeline and different ways to get media from selects sequences into an edit. Other editing techniques like ripple trims / rolling trims as well as slip / slide edits will be discussed. We'll also take a look at setting up a multi-camera edit and using multicam tools for music video editing..<br>**Class 5** In the audio lesson we are going to go through many different aspects of audio in an Adobe Premiere Pro CC project. One important overall concept we'll discuss is track-based audio mixing vs. clip-based audio mixing and Premiere Pro supports them both. Topics covered include: keyframing audio levels with "rubber bands" as well as recording keyframes with automation, setting up and recording voice over right to the timeline, working with audio at a subframe level and keyboard shortcuts for adjusting audio levels and volumes. We'll also work on changing some incorrectly imported audio clips that we've already edited in the timeline..<br>**Class 6** We are talking about effects. This is a long lesson as there is a lot of material to cover as effects work can go quite deep in Premiere Pro. We'll spend a few minutes looking at basic keyframing before digging into more depth with both keyframe-based time remapping and using PPro's built-in masking and tracking to remove some unwanted text from a frame. We'll wrap up this class looking at After Effects integration with text templates and Dynamic Linking..<br>**Class 7** Color - Post-production wouldn't be complete without color correction and color grading. Like all good NLEs Adobe Premiere Pro CC has its own share of color correction tools including a 3-way color corrector and a full complement of video scopes. While PPro's built-in tools are entirely capable this week's session will venture beyond Adobe a bit to explore other color grading options..<br>**Class 8** We are going to look at finishing within Premiere Pro. When we say finishing we're not talking entirely about finishing an edit within Premiere Pro but also prepping offline edits for moving into color correction and final finishing. We'll look at preparing a music video for color correction by collapsing our edit, flattening multi camera edit and exporting reference copies and conforming lists. We will also export a multichannel Quicktime file and upload automatically via FTP..<br>**Class 9** We're going to look at Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2014 integration with a number of other products. Of course we'll briefly look at some video effect and transition plug-ins (FxFactory, Red Giant, HitFilm) but we'll focus more on workflow integration tools. Those third party tools include external from Premiere Pro video scopes with ScopeBox, extensions including Pond5 and PluralEyes, and integration with Imagineer Systems mocha Pro. We'll also take a brief look at Adobe Audition integration and using Adobe Bridge to browse content like a stock footage and music library. Beyond browsing through Bridge we'll look at using Final Cut Pro X as a media browsing tool..<br>**Class 10** Potpourri - No lesson can cover an application as deep as Adobe Premiere Pro CC in its entirety, digging into every nook, cranny and feature so in this final lesson we'll look at some things we've overlooked and follow up on any lingering questions from the forums. |

| [458](https://www.fxphd.com/details/458/) | [GOL101](https://www.fxphd.com/details/458/) | Introduction to Golaem Crowd | **Class 1** Overview and First Crowd Setup. We'll touch on each of the main tools as we go through the process of setting up a basic spectator crowd, from an empty scene to render. You'll get a feel for the overall crowd workflow and an understanding of how the different parts of Golaem work together..<br>**Class 2** Character Maker - Skeleton Definition and Motion Conversion. We begin the conversion of Maya assets to custom Golaem Crowd formats by translating our Maya character skeleton into a Golaem Character Definition. We'll look at some of the animation editing tools, output a Golaem animation file and learn how to translate animation from one skeleton to another. Finally we'll take a look at a custom character set up for a crowd, a hybrid cyclist/bike skeleton..<br>**Class 3** Character Definition and Asset Management. Continuing to set up our Maya assets, this week we'll look at how we use character geometry and materials in the crowd. We'll set up a custom character, learning how to switch between multiple pieces of geometry and materials on a single character type and some tricks we can use to create additional visual diversity..<br>**Class 4** Entity Distribution/Placement. Now we have our crowd assets we can start to place them in an environment. We'll look at various techniques that allow us to do this, from the standard population tool to the paint tool and generating particles from an image..<br>**Class 5** Behavior Editor - Tools + Motion and Geometry Behaviors. In this class we'll start to examine ways we can create behaviors for our crowd entities. We'll learn about the nodes we can use to build behavior trees such as logic operators, containers and stop/start triggers. We'll then take a look at the geometry behavior, demonstrating how to use a cached nCloth sim with our crowd..<br>**Class 6** Behavior Editor - Character Locomotion. The locomotion behavior enables us to have walking crowd characters that use ground adaptation and dynamically switch animations. We'll set up a walking crowd and spend some time with related elements including navmesh creation, obstacles, goto and navigation behaviors..<br>**Class 7** Behavior Editor - Additional Behaviors. We'll go through some additional behaviors and settings that can be used with our crowd characters, such as 'constraint', 'formation' and 'look at' behaviors. We'll also take a look at the flocking behavior that can be used for groups of birds and other flying creatures..<br>**Class 8** Simulation and Rendering. Taking a break from the behavior editor, we'll go through the process of simulating and rendering our crowd. We'll look at ways we can manipulate our sim to improve our final result and various settings that may be useful..<br>**Class 9** Behavior Editor - Physics. Back into the Behavior Editor one last time to show how we can integrate ragdoll physics and forces with our crowd characters. We'll set up a scene with guys falling over obstacles, falling over each other, rolling down a slope and getting thrown onto the ground by an explosion. We'll see various techniques we can use to achieve effects like these and how to deal with the issues that arise..<br>**Class 10** Production Tips and Tricks. We'll look at some useful techniques across several areas of Golaem, including ways to iterate more quickly on your simulation, making global changes to all crowd fields, how to create greater visual diversity from just one texture, quickly editing animation files and how to set up avoidance for non-crowd animated elements in your scene. |

We'll look at creating a magical aura around our character and sending out a shock wave..<br>**Class 3** Magical Elements 2: In our third class, we'll create a symbol of power. Since we're focusing on getting a fantasy look from our effect we'll need to control some magic particles; something that Houdini shines in..<br>**Class 4** Creating the Particles: We'll work at creating a layer of our effect using points and see how we can continue to add recursive attributes onto points to get the control that we need out of our geometry..<br>**Class 5** Creating the Surface: It's time to create the second layer of the force field the geometry. We'll look at how we can keep the particles in-line with what the surface is doing and vice versa to make sure that everything fits together coherently..<br>**Class 6** Interaction: What's a force field if there's nothing to collide against it? We'll look at how we can get the force field to react with other effects..<br>**Class 7** Dissolving The Effect: Just as important as creating an effect, is figuring out a way to kill it. We'll look at how we can disintegrate our effect..<br>**Class 8** Shading: In today's class we'll dive into the shading context and look at how we can make the most of our particles and surface. Procedural noise, ramps, and normals are going to become second nature here..<br>**Class 9** Rendering & Compositing: The last stage is finally upon us. We look at how we'll actually get our field rendered and some techniques we can use in comp to make our effect better..<br>**Class 10** Exploring The Effect – Houdini's strength is the ability to compartmentalize work flows and easily make modifications to a project. Though our project has had a specific end result, we're going to take a moment to reflect on what we've done and see how we could have taken things in a different direction. |

| [477](https://www.fxphd.com/details/477/) | [RND203](https://www.fxphd.com/details/477/) | Shading with RIS in RenderMan | **Class 1** Overview of course. We cover background as well as overview for the course to get a big-picture understanding of where we will be going with Shading in RIS: the new LM Shader System, Pattern nodes, SE Expressions, and much more!<br> **Class 2** LM Shader System: Part1. A conceptual explanation of the way this new layering & shading system works in RIS mode, as well as our 1st simple example with PxrLMMixer & PxrLMLayer in a RenderMan Studio session.<br> **Class 3** In Part2 of our look at LM Shading, we jump into the functionality and differences of the "Clearcoat" lobe in the LMLayer node. The Clearcoat supports a really useful "thickness" functionality, that works in conjunction with Transmission color, as well as Specular color. We look at this concept and its application and how those 3 parameters work together, as well as comparing the Clearcoat lobe to the Specular lobe in LMLayer.<br> **Class 4** In Part3 of our look at LM Shading, we take a look at the new LMGlass material in RIS, and its functionality in doing accurate colored glass shadowing. Having some photo reference images of our goal, we start off with a backgrounder in colored glass shadowing and examine the techniques available to us in Reyes mode with RMSGlass, the very different results we get there and the pros & cons. We then use the same scene on RIS PxrGlass and LMGlass, and see how the "thin" shadow feature in LMGlass can be very useful, and compare it to the PathTracer "Allow Caustics" rendering mode with our colored glass as well as the bi-directional VCM. We then change up the light source from an HDR Lightmap to an arealight to show how the colored glass shadows behave differently in different lighting environments, and having all these tools at our disposal allows the artist flexibility and creativity in the render result depending on their specific lighting scenario and shadowing methods.<br> **Class 5** Patterns: Part1. We start off with patterns by exploring the geometry node "PxrTangentField". This is a very useful Pattern node for creating anisotropic materials when plugged into the Shading Tangent (Tn) in the Advanced Specular or Advanced Clearcoat of our LMLayer, or in the Shading Tangent of the LMMetal material. There are a number of ways to input a pattern into the PxrTangent Field, including a small tile-able vector map, procedural noise, or blended ramps: we explore all these methods in 3 different scene files and unique applications of PxrTangentField.<br> **Class 6** We move onto a very powerful Pattern node: PxrSeExpr. SE Expressions are a scriptable pattern generator, a scripting language created by Disney and made Open Source. It's great to have this node inside of RenderMan and we start off with some basic expressions of colored voronoi noise, see how we can visualize it quickly, and connect it into a bump normal slot on our LMMetal material, demonstrating the flexibility of this powerful tool. We'll build on this further with SE Expressions, getting more complex expressions and layering them into our shading network.<br> **Class 7** More SE Expressions, branching out into some vector dot products using functions such as dotprod(), smoothstep(), abs(), clamp() in a useful utility that is great for rendering cloth, as well as two-tone car paint! We step through each line of our SE Expression to get a firm understanding, while applying it to a few different scene files under different rendering contexts.<br> **Class 8** Continuing on Se Expressions, we bring up our voronoi fractal example and show how animating it has the objects "swimming" through the noise, as mentioned in a previous Class: we solve this by transforming our seed point for the pattern into object space, and showing how it "sticks" nicely in the animation. We then move onto combining these handy fractal patterns with textures, to see the real power of Se Expressions in procedurally exposing texture patterns based on a fractal: the best of both worlds!<br> **Class 9** We go behind the scenes and show how to save our presets from our SE Expressions code, so we don't have to cut/paste from an external text editor all the time, and more importantly so we can share entire libraries of presets with others. This gives us easy access right in the material node to access all our saved SE Expressions with one click, as well as any other preset settings such as an entire physically based materials library all in the PxrDisney material. We show where RenderMan looks for these preset folders for each material inside our Maya preferences directory. Finally we write a really handy python script that loops through every node of a certain type in our scene, and writes out individual preset .mel files for each one: this is a handy automation tool and then you can easily install & share your preset library.<br> **Class 10** We go back into the LM shading system by creating a substrate material (Subsurface, or diffuse/glass/metal) and building on top of it via LMLayer and LMMixer nodes: we touched on this earlier with some issues and there have been updates in RenderMan to make this functionality work properly, and we demonstrate this now functioning layered shading network. Once we've built up this layered network, we bring in another layer of complexity and creativity by adding our SE Expr procedural & texture noise patterns to drive the Layer Mask of each layer: this is bringing together a number of different topics we covered throughout the course! With this knowledge and toolkit at our disposal, the artist can now get very creative with complex shading networks to create materials such as rust on metal, paint on glass, dirt and scratches on any base substrate … the creativity is limitless! |

| [479](https://www.fxphd.com/details/479/) | [HOU213](https://www.fxphd.com/details/479/) | Creating Dynamic Destruction FX in Houdini, Maya, & Nuke | **Class 1** Creating polygon debris assets for the shot from existing 3D models. This process includes searching through a library of existing debris and broken 3D assets as well as custom modeled assets for other shots and modifying them for the specific shot. This will include breaking up the chairs, desks, concrete and scaling geometry to different sizes. This is a very important aspect of 3D dynamic simulation as the particles or rigid body simulations will look good or look generic based off the geometry used..<br>**Class 2** Layout of the floors of the building with rigid body dynamics furniture. Once the broken furniture is setup with dynamics it can be positioned inside the building on one floor in a realistic manner like and office layout. Once it’s in place a single floor can be simulated to see how the simulation works as a first pass for rigid body furniture..<br>**Class 3** Setup of the breaking glass particle system. For the broken glass a window needs to be setup as a breakable rigid body simulation used to animate the smashing shards of glass falling out. This is going to be setup in a memory efficient way because millions of particles of broken glass are going to be generated as the driller smashes through many windows. The furniture from class 02 is going to be used to break the glass using RBD simulation..<br>**Class 4** Setup of the falling paper simulation. Paper spins and flutters slowly down through the air from photocopiers and office equipment. The paper simulation is done using very basic geometry of the paper with a complex particle field to simulate the air resistance and the wind. The falling speed of the paper is important to distinguish it from the other objects like desks and chairs..<br>**Class 5** Variation in debris. Now that we have setup the first pass of our FX simulations we are now going to create natural variation in the scale, colour, rotation, speed, shape and movement of our dynamic effects. Changing geometry sizes and creating new variety in colour and form of debris is important to achieve more natural effects..<br>**Class 6** Debris dust trails. The smaller debris that has been simulated can have plumes of dust flowing off them. This can be setup as a particle or fluid simulation to create tendrils of smoke emitting from the rigid body geometry. This is a great technique which also makes the debris more visible and adds extra value to already completed FX..<br>**Class 7** Fiery explosions. Some of the explosions from destruction in movies are fluid effects and some are live action footage composited. We are going to have a look at how to combine a pre-made pyro fluid simulation explosion and import it into our scene and position it onto the building. This is a typical workflow where fx rigs or assets have been already created for previous movies or sequences and can be re-used. We will set the start frame of the simulation and render it with an alpha channel..<br>**Class 8** Baking the simulations for handover to other departments. This is an important procedure where all particle and rigid body simulations are “baked” so that another TD can continue on with the work and use your FX simulations in their shot with their FX simulations. After you are finished a simulation it is “published” with exactly correct naming of all nodes and caches correctly named in a correct directory. All of the latest dynamics sim data is copied from local directories into published directories that other artists can access. This lesson will cover the “baking” of rigid body dynamics and particle simulations to disk, how to batch rename files, how to name nodes correctly in Maya and Houdini for publishing..<br>**Class 9** Playblasting or Rendering for FX review. Basic lighting for the simulation needs to be rendered for Dailies (review), so that the FX Lead and Director can review your work. To do this we can first do a playblast in Viewport 2.0 and then composite the different simulations together in Nuke X. This all takes a lot of patience and understanding of the limitations of software and (RAM) memory, as everything can’t be loaded into the one scene and rendered all together..<br>**Class 10** How to iterate your simulations for the Director. This lesson will take us through the process of iteratively changing the simulation based on a directors feedback notes. As if you would ever want to re-simulate! Iterating massive, slow, multi-part simulations (which all depend on each other for interaction) can be a challenge, but this is a crucial part of the simulation process. Directors are fairly kind though as much of the sins of the 3D FX department can be covered over with composited live action dust, explosions and sparks common in today’s blockbuster movies. As FX is approved, the further Lighting and Compositing stages not covered in this course are touched on to conclude. |

Finally the importance of matching the background plate or photography and the HDRI orientation and color will be covered to put together a test scene to highlight correct HDRI setup..<br>**Class 4** Finalizing FX Elements from Visual Effects Shot. Often additional minor elements may be requested by the Sequence Lead and these can be fine tuned or added in so that they can be lit and rendered ready for compositing in Nuke. All the FX Elements need to be setup in the best way possible for Rendering in separate passes or AOV layers for the Compositor. We cover how to setup new or existing fx elements for rendering..<br>**Class 5** Setup of HDRI lighting and Projection mapped background plate. We cover the correct professional setup of the high res background plate which is projection mapped onto building geometry, as well as the import and setup of the HDRI image for lighting the scene. The orientation of the HDRI can be changed to adjust the lighting and the brightness adjusted..<br>**Class 6** Rendering of first lighting passes for import into Nuke. We cover planning out the AOV passes and separate layers required for compositing the shot together in Nuke. 3D Software is slow to re-render minor changes while Nuke is faster, so this will be shown in example scenes. The advantages and dis-advantages of "lighting in Nuke" will be covered showing the file sizes and scene complexity for outputting lighting render passes to re-light the scene in compositing software vs using the 3D package to finalize lighting..<br>**Class 7** Compositing in Nuke overview.

The fastest way to ruin a great model is to put a horrible texture on it. We'll start putting textures on our treasure chest. Believe it or not, but the majority of textures that were used to create the final render were created right here in Modo using the procedural texture generation engine. We'll explore the full spectrum of procedural texture that we can create in Modo and some techniques to apply them to our model. Masking materials and material groups in the shader tree will help us create the illusion we are after, so we'll spend a lot of time exploring the masking system. In addition, we are going to be blending a lot of layers together, so we'll explore how the blend modes work too!.<br>**Class 8** Baking. Modo has a really great texture baking engine and we are going to be want to take advantage of it for our scene. Part of being a great 3D modeler is creating assets and scene that are optimized for rendering, so we have a responsibility to the rest of the production pipeline to make our scenes render efficiently. Baking normal and ambient occlusion maps will help us extract high resolution detail from our geometry and place it on lower, more render efficient objects. In addition, we'll take a look at the cage based baking system in Modo and compare the results to the default system..<br>**Class 9** Nodal Shading..<br>**Class 10** Final Rendering. |

| [492](https://www.fxphd.com/details/492/) | [3DE202](https://www.fxphd.com/details/492/) | 3DEqualizer Tricks of the Trade | **Class 1** Utilizing python scripts for ‘markerless’ object tracks. We use simple python to create a free moving 3D object track to add a tablet device to a shot - when no tracking markers were used. This technique will also prove invaluable for ‘markerless’ 3D screen placements..<br>**Class 2** Tricking the calculation to solve impossible shots. We look into a typical problem, where only a couple of markers were used during the shoot but we require a full 3D camera move. We can ‘trick’ 3DE into thinking that we are working with a dynamic lens, when in reality we are actually reverse engineering the track to create a fixed focal length camera move. This is a really impressive technique that will make you stand out as someone who really understands the intricate logic behind this complex software..<br>**Class 3** Using reference images to directly affect object tracks. This technique provides super accurate results for all kinds of object tracks. In this example we will look at object tracking a moving motorcycle and achieving really clean animation which is vital for the wider CG process..<br>**Class 4** Rendering ‘dailies’ very quickly directly from 3DE. In the studio, every track needs to be reviewed in ‘daily’ sessions or screenings by your CG supervisor. It is so often the case that so much time is wasted by: exporting the track > rendering in 3D software > compositing. Why spend this time on this when we can accurately render directly from 3DE? This time can be spent on get through more shots! These renders can be used on your reel!.<br>**Class 5** Handling lens distortion and overscan. We will look at the whole pipeline! Calculating the distortion, exporting what we need and running it through external software. 3DE has internal solution for this...but we will look at a more robust pipeline. For the first half, we will be in 3DE4. The second half will be conducted in Nuke and Maya. If you wish to follow along, then please ensure that you have Nuke and Maya installed. You will also need the 'Lens Distortion Plugin Kit v1.8.1' for Nuke. This is free and can be found here: www.3dequalizer.com/index.php#?site=tech_docs.<br>**Class 6** Multi frame reference point placement and ‘reel-in’s’. This is an amazing technique for accurately placing 3D points anywhere in your scene on (virtually) any object without actually tracking that point 2D! We can break our timeline down to influence our solution and set things up before moving into the layout phase in our 3D software..<br>**Class 7** The sports zoom. Fast moving shot? Camera zooming in and out on the action? We will look into a ‘sport’s zoom’ shot which are very common in a TV commercials and can be a real hassle unless you have this skill under your belt..<br>**Class 8** Constraints. There are typical camera moves that directors of photography favor. We will look at different camera movement types and how to work with them. We cover three shots, but we will focus mainly on the ‘circle constraint’. This is very common for ‘pack shots’ when we really needs to show off a product. Circular movement is difficult to tackle and we will discuss why certain constraints are so effective!.<br>**Class 9** Estimating lens distortion. We will look at a shot which has lots of lens distortion, but no lens grid was shot. 3DE can do a great job of ‘parameter adjusting’ for lens distortion, but what happens when we can’t get the right result and we need a solution that works? We will talk about how to ‘visually estimate’ lens distortion so we do not end up with ‘weird’ results at the compositing stage..<br>**Class 10** Point offsetting. Appending the position of 2D points is one of the best ways to stop jumps and skips in your tracks. But proceed with caution! This can be a tricky technique which can lead to misleading results. We will cover examples of when and when NOT to do this!. |

| [496](https://www.fxphd.com/details/496/) | [FLM211](https://www.fxphd.com/details/496/) | Graphic Design in Flame | **Class 1** We start creating something from nothing. Let’s build a 3D logo that could be a movie banner or TV News opener out of glass using only Flame's built in tools..<br>**Class 2** We look a different style of graphic work using Batch. We will create a watercolor style look to a Japanese character and vary the technique to create interesting graphic effects with clouds..<br>**Class 3** We look at techniques you can use in broadcast design or commercials. We look at the character axis tool for 3D text in Action, displacement mapping and shadows to create a simple “Netflix” style animation. We also create an involved 3D grid environment entirely in Action using text and primitives for a clean minimalist look. We also show how to make a trapcode style path in Flame as well as particles making vapors following a light source as it orbits and lights some 3D text..<br>**Class 4** We look at “Graphics in Environments”. With the help of Action, Substance Textures, IBL’s, Lighting and Shadows we explore some of the possibilities when placing 3D text or 2D logos in helicopter shots of rivers, building forecourts or beaches..<br>**Class 5** We look at instancing and Replica as tools for motion graphics. We will look at instancing for the benefit of those of us who also use Smoke without the Replica tool to achieve the same result. There is a setup for an Art Deco style piece for you to examine that uses Replica as a background effect..<br>**Class 6** Lighting, lens flares, rays, fog and grunge in graphic design. Atmospherics. Action and Matchbox make a great artists palette..<br>**Class 7** We focus on typography and color as design tools. There are no setups in this class as the demonstrations are more theoretical although everything was created in Flare or Flame. We cover typographic layout, recommended kerning and leading values in text and how to arrange type for a particular style. We look as well at opposite and complementary colors interacting with luminance to create various psychological effects..<br>**Class 8** We look at the desktop paint module in the Tools menu. We look at the main differentiator with its sister node in Batch; Autopaint. We explore some of the possibilities for artists to conjure effects with a difference using a tool that is regarded somewhat unfairly as outdated. In particular we make graphics using various clips to influence brush strokes as well as tracking paint brushes to images..<br>**Class 9** We look at a few miscellaneous tips that Rob has collected over the years. Although some are similar to what can be achieved using Sparks they are still worth watching if you like your effects to be unique in comparison to the easily repeatable plug-in looks we often see. The tips we will investigate include a crystal ball, simple starbursts and rays for logo design utilizing the Motif node. We also take another look at Atomize as a tool for transitioning graphics..<br>**Class 10** We build a 3D sign out of almost nothing…well, we do employ SVG elements from Illustrator just like you might do on a real job. As part of our 3D sign, we create a Flash Gordon style rocket with shiny metal finish only utilizing 3D shape’s tools. Action offers us Projection mapping in a Diffuse Map image so we can add interactive lighting to an otherwise flat photograph to finish our effect. |
| [497](https://www.fxphd.com/details/497/) | [HOU215](https://www.fxphd.com/details/497/) | Lighting & Rendering Explosions in Houdini & Nuke | **Class 1** 3D Truck Animation & 3D Camera Match Moving. An introduction to the course and an overview of the course materials and software used. Then the initial camera match moving of an example background plate will be done in Maya as well as some basic animation on the 3D Maya truck using key frames and expressions will be completed. This will allow for a moving shot with an animated vehicle ready for FX..<br>**Class 2** Preparing the Truck Geometry for Destruction via Rigid Body Simulation. The Maya model will need to be “fractured” in Maya & Houdini for it to work correctly for Rigid Body Dynamics destruction. The 3D artist carefully breaks the model up into natural variations of debris size, from large to small and these are grouped in clusters which can be simulated to break apart on a given key frame. This debris modelling stage is crucial for the natural “look” of the rigid body dynamics and any particle trails coming off debris as the more natural the breaks in the geometry the more natural the fx simulations will look..<br>**Class 3** Rigid Body Dynamics Simulation in Houdini. The setup and testing of Rigid Body Simulation to destroy the truck geometry as if blown up with explosive fuel. This will be a really exciting and fun lesson to use forces in the Bullet Rigid Body solver to explode the pre-scored geometry in Houdini and then animate the key areas and timing of the explosions. This will allow students to see how to simulate and bake out the simulated RBD geometry to Alembic files ready for Maya..<br>**Class 4** Particle Debris geometry setup in Houdini & Maya. Particles are much faster and easier to work with than Rigid Body Dynamics for small pieces of debris. This lesson will focus on how to create randomly flying small pieces of metal and steel debris which will be simulated using geometry and particles. This can be done in Houdini and also in Maya and both scene setups will be provided for reference..<br>**Class 5** Assault Missile Trails from the mountaintop in Houdini. An important part of any action film is Missile trails. This lesson will cover the reproduction of an RPG missile trail fired from a hilltop. This lesson will cover how to setup the materials and lighting of the trail as well as how to get a natural simulated wind motion to blow the smoke away..<br>**Class 6** Setting up large scale Pyrotechnic Explosion simulations in Houdini. This lesson will introduce the fx setup for large scale pyrotechnic explosions. Concepts including Fuel, Temperature, buoyancy, disturbance, noise, frequency and many other fx simulation terminology will be explained in the context of the shot. An fx simulation will be setup to give a natural and large pyro fuel explosion using multiple emitters and dynamic forces..<br>**Class 7** Rending & Materials of Pyrotechnic Explosions in Houdini. Following on from the previous lesson which covered pyrotechnic fx setup, this lesson will cover the finalization of the simulation and the adjustment of colours in the fire and smoke materials. The materials for the pyro elements can be adjusted to give the correct sharpness and look of the explosion and the transparency ramp of the density makes a huge difference to the look of fire and explosions in FX simulations in CG. All of this will be tweaked and explained so that artists can see how to art direct their pyrotechnic elements to match as closely as possible to live action footage..<br>**Class 8** How to setup additional fire & smoke trails from rigid body debris. The flying rigid body debris geometry is already animated and it can have additional fire trails and smoke trails. This class will cover how to setup the rigid body dynamics geometry to emit fire & smoke and how to add enough wind disturbance to break up the trails so that they are not too uniform. This class will also cover sub frame sampling so that there isn’t a stepping effect for dust trails off the debris..<br>**Class 9** Rendering and Compositing for FX Review using Mantra, Renderman & Nuke X. Once the fx simulations are completed they can all be rendered out using preliminary lighting and composited together in Nuke X for review. This is a very involving process integrating 3D renders from multiple 3D packages as well as live action background plates together into a final image. This class will cover tips and tricks on how to manage all the complex 3D scenes and how to setup a simple and easy to use composite node setup that will allow artists to output a high quality final image for review including all the fx elements..<br>**Class 10** How to update simulations if a Director wants a new FX Art Direction. Many times with pyrotechnic effects elements, what the director wanted is very different to what the software simulates. This class will cover the scenario when a Director wants a very specific and different look to the simulation which has been setup by the artist. Topics covered will include how to visually communicate new fx simulation direction with the client, how to explain the limitations of the software, explaining animation, vs simulation and how to make adjustments to rigid body simulation animation, particle fx animation and pyro simulation animation for the Director. |
| [498](https://www.fxphd.com/details/498/) | [MSV102](https://www.fxphd.com/details/498/) | Introduction to Massive | **Class 1** Getting started. The introductory lesson will give a general overview of Massive and introduce theoretical concepts such as Fuzzy Logic. We'll take a tour of the user interface and look at the various aspects of the software such as the brain, body, motion and scene pages and how they relate to each other. Geoff will also discuss the usual pipeline of a massive project in a production environment..<br>**Class 2** We will look at the Body page in Massive where you define the physical characteristics of a Massive agent. We'll cover agent parameters and look at the various aspects that make up the body of a Massive agent. We'll take a detailed look at the body segments which comprise the skeleton and build a skeleton and collision-shape body for our car agent. A simple brain will be created which will allow us to drive the car around and we'll finish up with a brief demo of dynamics in Massive..<br>**Class 3** Brains! pt 1. This lesson will be the first of a two-part set looking at brains in Massive. It will give detailed coverage of each of the brain nodes, how each one functions "under the hood" and the different ways they can be connected together. We'll discuss fuzzy logic in the context of a Massive brain and show how the brain nodes implement fuzzy logic to control the agent's behavior..<br>**Class 4** Brains! pt 2. In part 2 of our look at brains in Massive we will use what we learned last week to start building the brain of our car agent. We'll set up fuzzy logic networks to handle controls for turning the wheels based on the forward velocity of the car, steering the car by the amount the front wheels are turning left and right, acceleration and braking controls as well as simulating effects such as weight transfer - the way the car's body leans during turns and pitches forward and back when accelerating..<br>**Class 5** We will look at how a Massive agent senses and interacts with its environment and adapts its behavior to match the terrain. We'll also look at how a Massive agent navigates in its environment using flow fields, terrain maps and lanes..<br>**Class 6** Senses. We'll cover how a Massive agent uses its senses such as sound, sight, touch and agent fields to allow it to be aware of and react to other agents..<br>**Class 7** We will continue looking at how a Massive agent interacts with its environment. We will use what we learned in the previous lessons to create a simple city environment for the car agents to inhabit. We'll create the lanes for our city environment and look at how to set up all the possible choices of which way to go at different kinds of intersections. We will then set up the brain of the car agent to be able to decide which of the lanes to follow depending on which direction it wants to go and the available directions at each intersection..<br>**Class 8** Environment Part 3 and Variation. This lesson we will complete our city environment by creating a traffic light agent to control the flow of traffic at the intersections. We'll also add some rules to allow the cars to give way to other cars already on the intersection and avoid collisions. Then we'll look at how you can use agent variables to modify an agent in order to create different kinds of vehicles that share a common brain..<br>**Class 9** We'll finish our simulation by adding pedestrians to our city scene and show how they can interact with each other and the cars..<br>**Class 10** We cover attaching geometry to an agent and assigning materials to allow us to create a production quality render. We'll also revisit variation and variables in the context of geometry and materials. We'll look at how to create a complete render including shadows. |
| [499](https://www.fxphd.com/details/499/) | [MYA222](https://www.fxphd.com/details/499/) | Maya Foundations: LookDev and Lighting | **Class 1** We start with a key foundation to Look Dev and Lighting, colour theory. We’ll be looking at various methodologies of dealing with colour in a VFX facility, and gain an understanding of what it means to work in a Physically Based pipeline. From there we move to Scene-Referred vs. Display Referred imagery, Gamma, Gamut, ACES, OpenColourIO and how to practically work in a Linear colour pipeline..<br>**Class 2** This begins a two stage look at the fundamentals of lighting. We begin by discussing the main aims of lighting before looking at the various stages of lighting a scene. We’ll start by understanding how to read the lighting in a background plate and lighting spheres taken on-set. Next we’ll look at how to light and match CG spheres to the ones taken on-set and how this helps as a basis for setting up your overall shot lighting..<br>**Class 3** We continue to look at the fundamentals of lighting. Having matched our chrome and grey spheres, we’ll progress on to our main model which we’ll start by lighting based off a simple grey material. From there we’ll add the main shaders / textures and finalize the lighting, matching it as closely as possible to the background plate. We finish up by quickly looking at basic integration techniques using Nuke..<br>**Class 4** We begin to look at High Dynamic Range Images and their use in lighting. We start with a set of bracketed photos taken using an 8mm fisheye lens and convert these into multiple HDRI’s. From there we use AutoPano Gigo to stitch these into a single LatLong image and finally Nuke to colour balance them to the background plate we'll be using..<br>**Class 5** We continue looking at HDRI’s. Having colour balanced our LatLong we now look at extracting the key light source from the image and cleaning up the remaining image. From there we take all our image material into Maya and use the data to light a scene based off the localised placement of the key light sources and using the cleaned up original LatLong..<br>**Class 6** We switch gears to Look Dev focusing entirely on Maya’s new system for shader building introduced in the 2016 version, along with the latest version of Mental Ray. We'll use this to look at the basis of Look Development and how best to approach projects..<br>**Class 7** We start a two stage project based around the 'Digital Emily 2' project developed by The Digital Human League. Initially this shot was generated using Chaos Groups V-Ray but we will re-LookDev it using RenderMan..<br>**Class 8** We continue to work on our Digital Emily projects, refining the Look Development and discuss the process of complex shader setups, the use of various texture maps and how best to light the model..<br>**Class 9** We move from Look Dev to Cameras. We start by covering the basics of photography and how f/stop, shutter speed and ISO affect the overall image. We then more into the 3D realm and examine the workings of our digital camera and how we can create a more plausible camera output that doesn’t break all the rules..<br>**Class 10** We look at the creation of Slap Comps using both single and multiple sample images, i.e. Deep. We start with a general overview looking at what a Slap Comp is and isn’t, from there we’ll look in-depth at Deep Image Data before covering how to output it in both Mental Ray 2016 and RenderMan. Then we’ll move into Nuke to build our own Slap Comp. |

It’s important to see the entire workflow as we will be doing it for every shot. We also explain where a previs artists fit in the Commercial Production Pipeline..<br>**Class 2** Creating a Custom Rigged Character Quickly. In the second lesson we learn how to use the Autodesk Character Generator, a free web app, to create a custom character. We then use the HIK system in Maya to automatically rig our character to accept motion capture data and/or hand animation. We will also add a hat, skateboard, and customize the texture of the model. At the end of the lesson you’ll have a fully rigged and textured character to animate..<br>**Class 3** The Creative and Real World Lenses. In the third lesson we break down the Agency Storyboards and the Director’s Treatment. We then hop into Maya and previs Shot 01, an ECU of the skater. We also discuss real world lenses and focal lengths, specifically the Arri Master Primes and Angeniuex Optimo 12x 24­290mm..<br>**Class 4** Viewport 2.0 Lighting and Basic Techvis (Shot 01 and 02). In the fourth lesson we explore the different lighting options inside Maya Viewport 2.0 (Open GL) with standard Maya shaders. We then add lighting to Shot 01 and continue to previs and light Shot 02. We look at what it might take create a shot that is 2” from the ground in techvis. We then bring our first stills into InDesign and Premiere..<br>**Class 5** HIK Character Animation (Shot 03 and 04). In the fifth class we previs Shot 03 and Shot 04. We begin by animating the skateboarder from standing to riding on the board. This animation will be used for Shot 03, 04, 05, and 06. We also explore lighting working with the HIK character rig in more depth..<br>**Class 6** Real World Camera Movement and Entrance Pupil (Shot 05). In lesson six we look at the difference between a real world camera and lens system and the Maya native camera. We then look at how a real world camera moves on a O’Connor 2575 fluid head tripod, a J.L. Fisher Model 10 Dolly, and Technocrane 22 with a Libra head. We then previs Shot 05 and compare a native Maya camera to a real world execution..<br>**Class 7** Previs Shot 06 and 07. In lesson seven we previs Shot 06 and look at some different camera moves using the native Maya camera and how a real world dolly would work. Next we move into modelling our main set piece, the stairs and ledge..<br>**Class 8** Previs Shot 08, 09, 10..<br>**Class 9** In lesson nine we previs Shot 11, 12, and 13..<br>**Class 10** Final Storyboard and Animatic and Previs Jobs.

How to use Nail, Hinge, Barrier, Pin, and Spring constraints to create more complex simulations, and how secondary motion can be achieved with paintable goal-weights. We’ll also look at applying natural forces with dynamic fields such as air, wind and gravity..<br>**Class 3** We look at how you can convert polygon models into nCloth objects. How you can paint cloth attributes such as bend, stretch, shear, and dent along with making the objects stiff, viscous, or flowing. We’ll explore how you can attach buttons, tear the cloth, and even control the movement with topology-independent constraints..<br>**Class 4** We look at Bullet Physics which can be used to create large-scale, highly realistic dynamic and kinematic simulations. We’ll create both soft and rigid bodies sims in a single system along with continuous collision detection. We’ll also look at how you can use Maya’s dynamic fields to enhance the simulations..<br>**Class 5** We shift gears to look at nHair.

Colour grading is a crucial aspect of integration of CG elements into live action background photography. This lesson will cover all the different colour grading nodes in Nuke X. Also covered will be puzzle mattes which are multi coloured hold out mattes which can be used to colour grade a specific part of 3D renders like tires or specific panels. This is a key element to colour work in Nuke X as these “grade mattes” help isolate areas to change colours without having to make manual roto shapes. LUT’s, Colour theory and colour spaces will also be covered..<br>**Class 10** How To Add Realistic Camera Optical Effects using RenderMan and Nuke X. Pixar’s Renderman 20 features many stunning “real world camera” effects which are traditionally added in 2D Compositing software using plugins. This lesson will cover the use of these optical effects to give the image an organic real look. Some of these new effects include setting the RenderMan v20 camera Aperture, adjusting the camera Bokeh, Shutter speed and selecting Lenses. These are all great true 3D solutions to replicating the look and behaviour of real world cinema cameras. Additionally in Nuke X similar optical effects in 2D will be covered including the awesome kronos node to produce slow motion effects, the defocus node, Sapphire Lense flare effects, and motion blur nodes as well as many other optical nodes. This should give a good overview of true 3D Rendered Optical effects by Pixar and 2D Compositing Optical Effects by Nuke and the advantages and disadvantages of both. |

How to film, light and design longer lecture style videos to make them more than just a talking head. This will be the third of our special interviews..<br>**Class 8** The art of making your film look unscripted and off the cuff. While some documentary work is completely run and gun, there is also often a desire to make planned video pieces ‘look' unscripted and off the cuff - when they aren't. This is actually much harder than it sounds. Ben will show you how to make convincing ‘doco’ style pieces that are still effective and not distracting - believable ‘raw’ and yet tightly controlled..<br>**Class 9** Insanely cool ways to make anyone look good. We have all been faced with the job of filming someone who has a face for radio (!) Ben Allen shows you 5 tricks for making anyone look good (and sound great) - no matter what lights you have to work with. An expensive lighting truck load of equipment is great but what can you do to add production value when you don’t have a team of people and a vast budget?.<br>**Class 10** Lighting tricks for engaging the audience - we close out the course with a range of lighting examples that will make your message more effective. Flat lighting is harsh and unforgiving but what options does one have away from a studio?. |

| [541](https://www.fxphd.com/details/541/) | [AFX304](https://www.fxphd.com/details/541/) | Advanced Scripting for After Effects, Part 2 | **Class 1** Learn the basics of gulp, in particular how to install it and how to use it to automatically combine all source files of a script into a single result file..<br>**Class 2** We add a lot of extra functionality to our automated gulp build system. In particular, we learn how to obfuscate and zip the result file, how to add a meaningful header with version information and how to implement a clean task..<br>**Class 3** We integrate gulp into our atom text editor and learn how to execute After Effects scripts directly from gulp. In order to do this, we also learn the basics of asynchronous execution and callbacks in JavaScript and Node.js. Finally, we learn how to configure a linter with gulp that monitors our code quality in the background..<br>**Class 4** All about linting. You learn how to work with the linter JSHint and how to configure it properly to deal with the special needs of After Effects ExtendScript..<br>**Class 5** Time for some team work! In this class, we setup a central code repository using the web service of bitbucket.org. We use it to share our code among several team members such that the code we write during the next classes can be developed by several people in parallel..<br>**Class 6** You’ve learned a lot about gulp already. But today, we are not just using it to build your scripting project, but to setup an automated Ae workflow: We configure gulp such that it monitors a spreadsheet file in the background and as soon as the spreadsheet file changes, it automatically renders the jobs described in the spreadsheet file. In this class, you do not just get a new perspective on gulp, but also learn the basics of scripting the render queue of After Effects..<br>**Class 7** We take an in depth look at rendering. You learn how a script can apply presets for render settings and output modules, adjust individual settings and send render jobs to Adobe Media Encoder..<br>**Class 8** We focus on your skill to write clean and modular code. We wrap all the knowledge you gained in the previous class into a convenient and intuitive function that will become your swiss army knife for scripting the render queue. To avoid repetitive parts in our code, we use advanced concepts like passing functions as argument of other functions..<br>**Class 9** Finally, it is time to bring everything together. First we finish our rendering function and then we merge the code of all team members into the final result. To do this you learn how to merge code with git and resolve merge conflicts when several team members modified the same part of the code in parallel. The end result is a fully automatic pipeline to render lower thirds. The content of the lower thirds is stored in a spreadsheet file that is monitored by our pipeline. As soon as the content of the spreadsheet changes on disk, a template project for the tower thirds is opened in After Effects. Then for each lower third contained in the spreadsheet, the content of the template project is updated and rendered immediately. |
| [542](https://www.fxphd.com/details/542/) | [DCT102](https://www.fxphd.com/details/542/) | Introduction to Digital Colour Theory | **Class 1** Getting the best images has to start with the camera and how the camera sensor deals with the images presented by your choice of lens. While we think the sensor records a full RGB image it really does not – it records some light levels and then this is interpreted by the camera’s electronics. Charles explains what an image matrix is and how to acquire colour information at the camera sensor. He also demonstrates additive colour mixing..<br>**Class 2** Being able to work successfully and produce accurate and predictable color science requires first and foremost knowing what all the key terms mean. In this class Charles demonstrates subtractive colour mixing and the ‘gamut’ of CMY colour space. Charles clarifies a bunch of common lightness, colour and video terminologies so you have the tools to build your own correct colour pipeline..<br>**Class 3** Have you ever wondered why an 18% grey patch looks actually mid grey, or exactly how very simple operations such as contrast work? In this class you will learn the theory behind 18 percent grey, the ‘code 100’ problem. You will also learn the use of different gamma settings and the confusion over brightness and contrast settings..<br>**Class 4** Colour science is not something that happens in the vacuum of a theoretical computer. In reality your working and display environment is key. In this class we look at the relationship between your display and its viewing environment, plus some common terms of image control and what they really mean. Charles also explores the technical parameters of RGB colour space and how the pixel values map to luminance at the display. We also look at how modern HD cameras maps tristimulus (or colorimeter) values into video signal levels and some of the common adjustments you can make in the camera..<br>**Class 5** The easiest colour space to understand is normally just a variant of RGB colour, but we will need to be able to understand moving between colour spaces and what the pitfalls are. This class you will learn how RGB colour space is transformed into YCbCr colour space, and the different flavours of colour “sub-sampling” are explained..<br>**Class 6** Nothing is more important to the emotion of a scene than its colour grading. Over the last decade colour grading has become more prevalent and more vital to understand, so much so that this class is completely devoted to Charles explaining the theory behind colour grading..<br>**Class 7** Since almost the invention of displays one tool has been used: Colour Bars. In this class we take a real look at colour bars, – what are they – what can you learn from them and more specifically the ‘pluge’ (short for “Picture Line-Up Generation Equipment”). The pluge is part of a modern set of colour bars and it aids in adjusting the bottom of the luminance range to avoid either washing out the black tones into grays or collapsing picture information into clip. Charles gets into details of the BT709 standard and how absolute illuminance affects the image appearance at the display..<br>**Class 8** The greatest innovation in colour space unification in a modern colour pipeline has been the ACES colour space. ACES offers a unified workflow for multiple modern cameras and sources while also operating at the very highest end of wide and modern Gamuts. In this class Charles explains the differences between various colour spaces and introduces the ACES colour space..<br>**Class 9** We continue our look at the high end and new ACES workflow. ACES is transforming major motion picture colour pipelines around the world. ACES is still very new and yet it has seen a huge take up by some of the best post houses and vfx companies in the world. In a sense, ACES is to colour what OpenEXR was to image files – a robust, serious format that takes some implementation but holds a bright future for solving many issues in implementing practical colour science..<br>**Class 10** We are all comfortable in taking about f-stops on set but people are less comfortable with logarithms, even given the close relationship between the two. In this class Charles shows the reason why log coding is used in image capturing and different data formats commonly used. |

From there we jump straight into Arnold creating Shaders, Lights, a Camera, and finally setting up and tuning the Renderer. By the end of this first class you’d have created your first Arnold render..<br>**Class 2** All about the Arnold Renderer, its settings and parameters. We run two scenes side by side, one using Mental Ray and the other Arnold focusing on speed and flexibility. In Arnold we specifically look at Sampling, Ray Depth, along with Object Settings and the Region of Interest found within Arnold's Render View..<br>**Class 3** We move our focus to the Shaders of Arnold. We start by looking at the many shaders that ship with Mental Ray and then more on to look at the small but extremely flexible list of Shaders for Arnold.

We delve deep into the main Arnold Area Light, SkyDome Light and Mesh Light. We look at key areas such as Exposure, Color Temperature, Blockers and the like. We also spend some time in Nuke looking at how to adjust an HDRI to get the best out of an our-door screen but adjusting the exposure of the sun to create more realistic shadows..<br>**Class 5** We focus on cameras and how in Arnold they closely mimic that of a real photographic camera through way of f/stop adjustments, Rolling Shutter, Depth of Field and Motion Blur. We also look a an number of tricks to help get the best out of the Renderer by adjusting the Camera Samples vs. Diffuse and Glossy..<br>**Class 6** We look in-depth at Render Passes and AOV’s. Using a new project we create Passes for all the key Shader types and look at how we can adjust the Data Outputs, Drivers and Filtering. We look at various additional passes such as Depth, Position and Normals. We also spend some time in Nuke looking at the Passes in more depth along with how to rebuild the beauty and use the over AOV’s..<br>**Class 7** We cover a mix of extra tools and functions that ship with Arnold. We start by looking at the ‘TX Manager’ used to convert texture files such as OpenEXR’s to Arnold Texture or .tx files. Next we look at the ‘Light Manager’ which can be used to control many aspects of the scene lighting along with enabling the user to create use Lights from within the managers UI. We also look at Rendering Deep EXR’s, working with Stand-In geometry and how you would create Fog and other Environmental effects. |

We’ll go over some modeling fundamentals in Cinema 4D as well as get some terminology down for the lessons going forward..<br>**Class 2** In our first of two parts of modeling our blocks, we’ll start from scratch and develop the basis for our block objects from a simple parametric object. We’ll learn how and where to access a variety of modeling tools in multiple ways within Cinema 4D..<br>**Class 3** By the end of this chapter we’ll have completed the modeling portion of our blocks. Each block will continue to have the same uniform modeling steps applied to them to create a series of objects that are all on the same page in terms of their design and construction..<br>**Class 4** This will provide an XPresso overview as well as the first steps towards getting a level of smart functionality within our project to have modular controls over the parameters of our blocks. We’ll discuss User Data, Logic Nodes, and the strategy behind creating control panels for our 3D projects in Cinema 4D using XPresso..<br>**Class 5** We will finish linking up our XPresso to gain all the functionality we want out of our blocks. By the end of the lesson users will be able to see the advantage of using this aspect of Cinema 4D to create smarter and more functional 3D projects. We cover Range Mapping, Iterations, and a multitude of nodes with various functions.4D. We’ll discuss creating materials, adding lighting and environments, and adding in more advanced effects to improve the quality of our final image..<br>**Class 6** This class lays out the strategy and process of designing a 3D object to be created with our blocks. We test drive our XPresso-linked blocks and see how much time and hassle the code from the previous chapters save when modeling something out of hundreds of individual pieces. By the end of the chapter we have two different objects we can use to create animations with in the following chapter..<br>**Class 7** In this lesson we will develop two different animation methods for our block objects created in the last chapter. One will involve MoGraph and another will involve some more XPresso. Each method presents a different animation result for assembling a #D object out of our blocks we created..<br>**Class 8** Here we will create a more detailed animation using MoGraph and a combination of multiple Effectors. Each Effector plays its part and combines to help create a more detailed level of animation that would be impossible to achieve without MoGraph helping us. The end result can be saved and used in other examples as well..<br>**Class 9** In our final chapter we’ll look at a few aspect on rendering our image within the Standard Renderer of Cinema 4D. We’ll discuss creating materials, adding lighting and environments, and adding in more advanced effects to improve the quality of our final image. |

The locomotion behavior enables us to have walking crowd characters that use ground adaptation and dynamically switch animations. We'll set up a walking crowd and spend some time with related elements including navmesh creation, obstacles, goto and navigation behaviors..<br>**Class 7** Additional Behaviors. We'll go through some additional behaviors and settings that can be used with our crowd characters, such as 'constraint', 'formation' and 'look at' behaviors. We'll also take a look at the flocking behavior that can be used for groups of birds and other flying creatures..<br>**Class 8** Simulation, Layout and Rendering. We'll go through the process of simulating and rendering before taking a look at two powerful new tools, the simulation cache library and layout..<br>**Class 9** Behavior Editor - Physics. Back into the Behavior Editor one last time to show how we can integrate ragdoll physics and forces with our crowd characters. We'll set up a scene with guys falling over obstacles, falling over each other, rolling down a slope and getting thrown onto the ground by an explosion..<br>**Class 10** Tips and Tricks. We'll look at some useful techniques across several areas of Golaem, including ways to iterate more quickly on your simulation, making global changes to attributes, how to create greater visual diversity from just one texture, quickly editing animation files and how to set up avoidance for non-crowd animated elements in your scene. |
